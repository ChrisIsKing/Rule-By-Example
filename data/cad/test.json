This is why we have an \"everything bubble\" right now. And why real estate values in many cities have gone extremely high.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last year the big four central banks stopped this money printing process and started raising interest rates which caused global asset markets to start crashing as the banks no longer had endless money to lend out they had to \"tighten lending standards\". In Canada they said it was the new \"mortgage stress test laws\", in the UK they said it was \"brexit uncertainty\", in Australia they said it was \"the royal commission into the banks\", and in the US they said it was a mix of Fed rate hikes and US-China trade talks.

Even thought they deny it, they have a tendency for the occult and of keeping secrets, but overall freemasonry teaches them a lot of good things. A popular myth is that Lucifer is the god of freemasonry, which is true, their version of Lucifer is that of a benevolent being who represents knowledge and truth and they believe a true mason must constantly seek knowledge for the sake of others. The same thing can't be said about the high ranking masons, who worship a lot of wicked deities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A good example of those high ranking masons could be the British royal family, like Prince William and Queen Elizabeth, because a lot of members of that family are 32-33 degree masons, the Rothschilds themselves have married with the British royals and they have married with a lot of the European noble families over time, like [the Aldobrandini family, which is part of the Italian/black nobility families.](https://saidit.net/s/conspiracy/comments/arg/the_italianblack_nobility_families/) So their wealth has grown over time.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 0: Be Civil [linebreak] Let's keep the talk and discussion on what ever the subject matter of the post may be. Resorting to personal quarrels and arguments that may use insults and other tribal-like behaviors will be deleted. Keep it civil. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 1: Correct Formatting [linebreak] The requirements for posting to this subreddit is to have a self contained opinion within the title. The text will be used to expand and elaborate on why you think/feel this way. You may also include why you think this is an unpopular or controversial opinion. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 2: Opinion must be unpopular/controversial [linebreak] This sub isn't just opinions, but unpopular and/or controversial ones. If your opinion has been posted to the subreddit recently, chances are it'll get removed. SO PLEASE SEARCH BEFORE SUBMITTING. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 3: No Reposts/Search Before Submitting [linebreak] If essentially the same opinion gets reposted it'll automatically mean it's not an unpopular opinion (within the context of the sub). It WILL get removed. If your opinion is about a ongoing event, there will usually be a mega thread where you can discuss there. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 4: No Spam [linebreak] New accounts are subject to a 24 hour waiting period before posting. Spamming will usually result to a perma ban. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 5: No Trolling [linebreak] Trolling is saying random unsolicited things that only serve to invoke a knee jerk reaction. Trolls will usually get permanently banned. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 6: Elaborate [linebreak] An important rule in this subreddit is that all opinions must be elaborated on. There is a discussion to be had, so please expand on what you have said. [linebreak] Your post must contain more than 160 characters (roughly two or three standard sentences) to avoid auto-deletion by automod. [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 7: Hate posts are not allowed [linebreak] Opinion can be unpopular unless it's blatantly a hateful post. Hostile, rude and aggressive behavior is not a necessity to express your opinion. Please be civil and and have respect. Bear in mind that justifying or endorsing pedophilia activities (sidenote: discussion on treatments of the mental health itself is fine), rape, race issues, assault or other similar crimes will usually count as hate speech. This does not mean you'll get banned for saying one crime is not as severe as another or saying you can understand why someone would commit a crime. Race baiting is a ban-able offence [linebreak]  [linebreak] RULE 8: No Low Effort/Satire Posts [linebreak] Any opinion that is not thought out well or posts that clearly have very little effort put into them will be removed. This also includes commonly posted opinions to the subreddit. Please note that obscure topics and meta commentaries on the subreddit do not constitute a valid unpopular opinion post.\"", "normal"], ["Where did I fuck up?", "normal"], ["Rules are often formatted so that enforcement is at the discretion of moderators.

Lord Donoughue also arranged for a meeting at the Department: with the Department's Under Secretary of State and the Department's Chief Scientific Adviser, among others. The meeting was held on 9 January 2014. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At the meeting, the Chief Scientific Adviser claimed that there was observational evidence for significant global warming. I claimed that there was no such evidence\u2014as per my critique. The Chief Scientific Adviser maintained his claim, but was unable to present any such evidence at the meeting. He said, though, that he would later send details of such evidence to Lord Donoughue. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Details of such evidence, however, were never sent. Thus, the Department seemed to effectively acknowledge that my claim was correct: observational evidence does not exist. Furthermore, twelve days after the meeting, on 21 January 2014, the Under Secretary made a statement in Parliament on behalf of the UK government. The statement was as follows. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Her Majesty's Government does not rely upon any specific statistical model for the statistical analysis of global temperature time series. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Global temperatures, along with many other aspects of the climate system, are analysed using physically-based mathematical models, rather than purely statistical models.  [HL4497] [linebreak]  [linebreak] In plain English, the UK government stopped using or relying on statistical analysis of observational evidence for global warming; instead, the government started relying solely on computer simulations of the climate system.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Since the first vaccines were created for smallpox, doctors knew and it was firmly established that brain inflammation, permanent brain damage and death have always been among most serious complications with vaccinations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just in case you weren't aware of it the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act was passed precisely because the number of lawsuits being filed against the vaccine manufactures for vaccine injuries and the losses they were incurring when they were consistently found to be guilty and held responsible for those injuries and personal damages in court was jeopardizing both their profits and even their continued existence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You want to begin this conversation, that's where it should commence from. Also take not that vaccines are not considered to be \"drugs\" nor are they held to the same rigorous and lengthy scientific testing that is applied to them, their efficacy, and any potential side-effects or long term effects that result from them. [linebreak]  [linebreak] By 1986 both Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court had declared vaccines to be \"unavoidably unsafe\" and proceeded to deliberately shield the drug companies from any and all product liability for the vaccines they made and sold.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you or your child was injured or died after a vaccination, you couldn't hold the drug company that made and profited from it or anyone who regulates, promotes, administers or mandates the vaccine accountable in a civil court of law in front of a jury of your peers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now anyone with product safety liability can be sued when any flaws in that products design or construction results in harm to any unsuspecting person that used and relied on them but not the vaccine manufacturers. Doctors can also be sued for malpractice **except** when they administer vaccinations that cause an injury or kill someone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Vaccines are the only product that the government both mandates and completely indemnifies with the over 3 billion already paid out in compensation for the serious injuries that have been proven to have been directly caused by them being charged back to the taxpayers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now it should be patently obvious that the more vaccines that are administered to individual children the greater the likelihood that those kind of injuries are going to take place among them and  that is precisely what has happened and is increasingly happening.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] (2) Secrecy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (A) No obligation of secrecy may be imposed on any person except in accordance with Rule 6(e)(2)(B). [linebreak]  [linebreak] (B) Unless these rules provide otherwise, the following persons must not disclose a matter occurring before the grand jury: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) a grand juror; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) an interpreter; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) a court reporter; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iv) an operator of a recording device; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (v) a person who transcribes recorded testimony; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (vi) an attorney for the government; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (vii) a person to whom disclosure is made under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii). [linebreak]  [linebreak] (3) Exceptions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (A) Disclosure of a grand-jury matter\u2014other than the grand jury's deliberations or any grand juror's vote\u2014may be made to: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) an attorney for the government for use in performing that attorney's duty; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) any government personnel\u2014including those of a state, state subdivision, Indian tribe, or foreign government\u2014that an attorney for the government considers necessary to assist in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) a person authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a73322. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (B) A person to whom information is disclosed under Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) may use that information only to assist an attorney for the government in performing that attorney's duty to enforce federal criminal law. An attorney for the government must promptly provide the court that impaneled the grand jury with the names of all persons to whom a disclosure has been made, and must certify that the attorney has advised those persons of their obligation of secrecy under this rule. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (C) An attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter to another federal grand jury. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (D) An attorney for the government may disclose any grand-jury matter involving foreign intelligence, counterintelligence (as defined in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7401a3003), or foreign intelligence information (as defined in Rule 6(e)(3)(D)(iii)) to any federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security official to assist the official receiving the information in the performance of that official's duties. An attorney for the government may also disclose any grand-jury matter involving, within the United States or elsewhere, a threat of attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent, a threat of domestic or international sabotage or terrorism, or clandestine intelligence gathering activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent, to any appropriate federal, state, state subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official, for the purpose of preventing or responding to such threat or activities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) Any official who receives information under Rule 6(e)(3)(D) may use the information only as necessary in the conduct of that person's official duties subject to any limitations on the unauthorized disclosure of such information. Any state, state subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official who receives information under Rule 6(e)(3)(D) may use the information only in a manner consistent with any guidelines issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) Within a reasonable time after disclosure is made underRule 6(e)(3)(D), an attorney for the government must file, under seal, a notice with the court in the district where the grand jury convened stating that such information was disclosed and the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) As used in Rule 6(e)(3)(D), the term \"foreign intelligence information\" means: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (a) information, whether or not it concerns a United States person, that relates to the ability of the United States to protect against\u2014 [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u2022 actual or potential attack or other grave hostile acts of a foreign power or its agent; [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u2022 sabotage or international terrorism by a foreign power or its agent; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u2022 clandestine intelligence activities by an intelligence service or network of a foreign power or by its agent; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (b) information, whether or not it concerns a United States person, with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to\u2014 [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u2022 the national defense or the security of the United States; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u2022 the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (E) The court may authorize disclosure\u2014at a time, in a manner, and subject to any other conditions that it directs\u2014of a grand-jury matter: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) at the request of a defendant who shows that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) at the request of the government, when sought by a foreign court or prosecutor for use in an official criminal investigation; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iv) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of State, Indian tribal, or foreign criminal law, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate state, state-subdivision, Indian tribal, or foreign government official for the purpose of enforcing that law; or [linebreak]  [linebreak] (v) at the request of the government if it shows that the matter may disclose a violation of military criminal law under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as long as the disclosure is to an appropriate military official for the purpose of enforcing that law. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (F) A petition to disclose a grand-jury matter under Rule 6(e)(3)(E)(i) must be filed in the district where the grand jury convened. Unless the hearing is ex parte\u2014as it may be when the government is the petitioner\u2014the petitioner must serve the petition on, and the court must afford a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard to: [linebreak]  [linebreak] (i) an attorney for the government; [linebreak]  [linebreak] (ii) the parties to the judicial proceeding; and [linebreak]  [linebreak] (iii) any other person whom the court may designate. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (G) If the petition to disclose arises out of a judicial proceeding in another district, the petitioned court must transfer the petition to the other court unless the petitioned court can reasonably determine whether disclosure is proper. If the petitioned court decides to transfer, it must send to the transferee court the material sought to be disclosed, if feasible, and a written evaluation of the need for continued grand-jury secrecy. The transferee court must afford those persons identified in Rule 6(e)(3)(F) a reasonable opportunity to appear and be heard. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (4) Sealed Indictment. The magistrate judge to whom an indictment is returned may direct that the indictment be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been released pending trial. The clerk must then seal the indictment, and no person may disclose the indictment's existence except as necessary to issue or execute a warrant or summons. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (5) Closed Hearing. Subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (6) Sealed Records. Records, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury. [linebreak]  [linebreak] (7) Contempt. A knowing violation of Rule 6, or of any guidelines jointly issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence under Rule 6, may be punished as a contempt of court.", "normal"], ["Boogaloo time boys!", "normal"], ["It's not just the classified information that needs review by Barr.

Astonishingly, for eight days after the tragedy, during thousands of hours of prime-time television coverage, virtually no one mentioned the word \"drugs.\" Then the issue was opened. Eric Harris, one of the shooters at Columbine, was on at least one drug. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The NY Times of April 29, 1999, and other papers reported that Harris was rejected from enlisting in the Marines for medical reasons. A friend of the family told the Times that Harris was being treated by a psychiatrist. And then several sources told the Washington Post that the drug prescribed as treatment was Luvox, manufactured by Solvay. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In two more days, the \"drug-issue\" was gone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Luvox is of the same class as Prozac and Zoloft and Paxil. They are labeled SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). They attempt to alleviate depression by changing brain-levels of the natural substance serotonin. Luvox has a slightly different chemical configuration from Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft, and it was approved by the FDA for obsessive-compulsive disorder, although many doctors apparently prescribe it for depression. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Prozac is the wildly popular Eli Lilly antidepressant which has been linked to suicidal and homicidal actions. It is now given to young children. Again, its chemical composition is very close to Luvox, the drug that Harris took. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dr. Peter Breggin, the eminent psychiatrist and author (Toxic Psychiatry, Talking Back to Prozac, Talking Back to Ritalin), told me, \"With Luvox there is some evidence of a four-percent rate for mania in adolescents. Mania, for certain individuals, could be a component in grandiose plans to destroy large numbers of other people. Mania can go over the hill to psychosis.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dr. Joseph Tarantolo is a psychiatrist in private practice in Washington DC. He is the president of the Washington chapter of the American Society of Psychoanalytic Physicians. Tarantolo states that \"all the SSRIs [including Prozac and Luvox] relieve the patient of feeling. He becomes less empathic, as in `I don't care as much,' which means `It's easier for me to harm you.' If a doctor treats someone who needs a great deal of strength just to think straight, and gives him one of these drugs, that could push him over the edge into violent behavior.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Arianna Huffington's syndicated newspaper column of July 9, 1998, Dr. Breggin states, \"I have no doubt that Prozac can cause or contribute to violence and suicide. I've seen many cases. In a recent clinical trial, 6 percent of the children became psychotic on Prozac. And manic psychosis can lead to violence.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] A study from the September 1989 Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, by Joseph Lipiniski, Jr., indicates that in five examined cases people on Prozac developed what is called akathesia. Symptoms include intense anxiety, inability to sleep, the \"jerking of extremities,\" and \"bicycling in bed or just turning around and around.\" Dr. Breggin comments that akathesia \"may also contribute to the drug's tendency to cause self-destructive or violent tendencies ... Akathesia can become the equivalent of biochemical torture and could possibly tip someone over the edge into self-destructive or violent behavior ... The June 1990 Health Newsletter, produced by the Public Citizen Research Group, reports, 'Akathesia, or symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, and purposeless movements of the feet and legs, may occur in 10-25 percent of patients on Prozac.'\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Other studies: [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"Emergence of self-destructive phenomena in children and adolescents during fluoxetine [Prozac] treatment,\" published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1991, vol.30), written by RA King, RA Riddle, et al. It reports self-destructive phenomena in 14% (6/42) of children and adolescents (10-17 years old) who had treatment with fluoxetine (Prozac) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. [linebreak]  [linebreak] July, 1991. Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Hisako Koizumi, MD, describes a thirteen-year-old boy who was on Prozac: \"full of energy,\" \"hyperactive,\" \"clown-like.\" All this devolved into sudden violent actions which were \"totally unlike him.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] September, 1991. The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Author Laurence Jerome reports the case of a ten-year old who moves with his family to a new location. Becoming depressed, the boy is put on Prozac by a doctor. The boy is then \"hyperactive, agitated ... irritable.\" He makes a \"somewhat grandiose assessment of his own abilities.\" Then he calls a stranger on the phone and says he is going to kill him. The Prozac is stopped, and the symptoms disappear. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The well-known Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics reveals a strange fact. It states that Ritalin [given for ADHD] is \"structurally related to amphetamines ... Its pharmacological properties are essentially the same as those of the amphetamines.\" In other words, the only clear difference is legality. And the effects, in layman's terms, are obvious. You take speed and, sooner or later, you start crashing. You become agitated, irritable, paranoid, delusional, aggressive. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In his book, Toxic Psychiatry, Dr. Breggin discusses the subject of drug combinations: \"Combining antidepressants [e.g., Prozac, Luvox, Paxil] and psychostimulants [e.g., Ritalin] increases the risk of cardiovascular catastrophe, seizures, sedation, euphoria, and psychosis. Withdrawal from the combination can cause a severe reaction that includes confusion, emotional instability, agitation, and aggression.\" Children are frequently medicated with this combination, and when we highlight such effects as aggression, psychosis, and emotional instability, it is obvious that the result is pointing toward the very real possibility of violence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In 1986, The International Journal of the Addictions published a most important literature review by Richard Scarnati. It was titled, \"An Outline of Hazardous Side Effects of Ritalin (Methylphenidate)\" [v.21(7), pp. 837-841]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Scarnati listed over a hundred adverse affects of Ritalin and indexed published journal articles for each of these symptoms.", "normal"], ["No one ever links SSRIs (which most shooters are on at the time) to the mental downfall of the shooters.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] It is said that when the Dharma (a complex word, but in this case it refers to the teachings that lead to liberation) is completely gone from the world and forgotten by men, we will have reached the end of the Kali Yuga, after which the fourth Buddha, Maitreya (who is, curiously, unlike most Buddhas, always portrayed sitting on a chair) will appear. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Interestingly, Maitraya will teach only the basic vehicle of liberation, known as the Theravada/Hinayana (\"way of the elders\" or something like that, and \"small vehicle\" respectively), whereas the current Buddha, Shakyamuni, who appeared 2500 years ago, also taught the Mahayana (great vehicle), the Vajrayana (diamond or thunderbolt vehicle), Mantrayana, Mahamudra and Dzogchen. \\[Edit: The latter four classes of teachings mentioned were in most cases not given through what could be called conventional means and not necessarily during the life time of the Buddha. Adherents of the Theravada/Hinayana schools will tell you that only the Pali Canon truly came from Buddha. Conversely, the higher schools will always include the teachings of the Theravada/Hinayana, which are a prequisite, beginning  with the Four Noble Truths and The Noble Eightfold Path.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The reason for that, is that the Buddha knew about the Kali Yuga: how full of disturbing emotions we'd become, and how much suffering we would experience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Mahayana is the path of the Bodhisattva, and along with the Hinayana it's prequisite for the practice of the higher vehicles, such as  Vajrayana, which is the vehicle of transformation. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Knowing we would have a lot of disturbing emotions and suffering, providing the teachings that allow for the transformation of that into fuel on the path to liberation, was important. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's so much to say about this and so many interesting little nuggest to be found in the wisdom traditions of the east. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Again, I don't know any of this to be true, and my basis for the above is almost completely an appeal to authority. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm going to delve more into the topic. I'll probably post the write-up on r/psychonaut rather than here though :) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: Spelling + a few details.", "normal"], [">anarcho monarchist [linebreak]  [linebreak] wtf?", "normal"], ["Here's my view: [linebreak]  [linebreak] In one way, you're correct: There is no death, because you're not your body. The essence of you, what is sometimes called the mind-stream, abides. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We have the taxonomy upside down: The basis of all that is experienced is mind, which, much like space, is ephemeral and cannot be easily pointed to, yet it is the very expanse in which phenomena occur. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We tend to accept the notion of the primacy of matter, but that's an a priori assumption and contradicts empiricism (long, long debate). Consciousness does not arise from matter; perceived matter arises from consciousness. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We find this appreciation in many spiritual traditions: The kingdom of god is within you, you have Buddha-nature, all is the Tao yet the Tao is nothing etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Quantum physicicst Max Planck said it in another way: [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force... We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for our bodies and everything else in this world, it doesn't matter what you believe. It actually seems a lot of people don't really accept they will die, at least not in a very visceral way, and not in a way that very often makes us behave accordingly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There isn't even a single black swan here. Do animals know they will die? If not, why do they die if your theory is correct? [linebreak]  [linebreak] A body (and ego for that matter) is a phenomenon based on causes and conditions which exhaust themselves. It is by definition a transient and compound phenomena. Such is the nature of dualistic experience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The path to immortality is pretty much the opposite of not believing in death as a human. Rather, it is to realize the potential we have in this form to transcend our basic ignorance of dualism and radical philosophical materialism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You might also enjoy Donald Hoffman's take on the issue of nature of consciousness and reality, though he doesn't go quite as far as I do here. [linebreak]  [linebreak] [http://themindoftheuniverse.org/play?id=Donald\\_Hoffman](http://themindoftheuniverse.org/play?id=Donald_Hoffman) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The biggest conspiracy ever, I believe, is the one we perpetrate against ourselves in every moment where we identify with anything other that the pure, lucid expanse of experience, which is not only our ultimate and absolute nature, but also the only thing we can know without a doubt exists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At this point, for the vast majority of us, our consciousness and experience misapprehends itself and splits all phenomena into a subject-object duality, which is a prequisite for the experience of causality, the functioning of which is what we perceive as time.", "normal"], ["When I see people litter, I just ask them if they love China.

Now in a divorce you have child support and been together long enough for alimony. Cheating isn't a mistake, it's a long series of choices that do irreparable damage. She did not care about you at all then, and she continued the lie each day she didn't tell you, robbing you of the opportunity to leave before conceiving a child and finding another more suitable  partner.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] - **How old is your child?** [linebreak]  [linebreak] - **Is your child the #1 most important thing in the world to you?** [linebreak]  [linebreak] - **Do you still love this woman?** (I'd be surprised if you didn't). [linebreak]  [linebreak] These are the important things you need to answer to understand and make a proper decision on what to do from here on. Being cheated on is a dreadful thing to experience but since there's a child involved here, hasty moves or bad decisions will affect the child more than it will affect you or her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You don't have to give me the answers but at the very least, answer them for yourself and remember that your child is the most important thing to think about right now.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If your child is under 18, a divorce won't wreck the child's life but it'll turn their world upside down quite a bit. Likewise, if you stay together, I can see the resentment building up and cause marital issues at home and if the child is present while they take place, it'll affect them badly as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You have financial problems as well that could come out of a divorce. You'll have to pay child support (likely). Alimony is another problem you'll (probably) encounter. You'll have less say in your child's life if your child chooses to live with the mother. You won't get to see the child as much as much.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you still love her then this makes this whole thing ten times harder than it already is. You can't help it but it's really not going to help you either. She might cheat on you again, she may even be cheating on you right now with a new person and you wouldn't even know it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you still have concerns about her cheating on you again, what would be the best course of action is to \"separate\" but only in your relationship and not your marriage. This is so the child gets the best benefit out of this. You're both still married, you live in the same house, you both take care of the kid but you're no longer \"together\". [linebreak]  [linebreak] That way, if she decides to cheat on you again, it won't cause any issues. You'll also be free to seek other women as well for your own benefit as well. And once the child reaches the age of 18 (or until the child moves out), you can decide to divorce her and forget about her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But if you feel you can actually work it out properly and still have a proper relationship then you should try to do just that. It's down to your judgement ultimately. Just remember, there's absolutely no reason why she wouldn't cheat again. She managed to hide this one from you for four years and you couldn't do a thing about it. *She had to tell you* and it was only because she couldn't handle the guilt anymore and even then, it was because she felt sorry for herself and not you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have to tell you, I'd be paranoid all the time. Every single time she went out and came home late, \"*is she fucking another guy again?*\" Every time she's on the phone, \"*is she texting another guy? What are they talking about?*\" Every time she acts weird, down or strange, \"*is she feeling guilty because she fucked another guy again?*\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] Or she doesn't want sex with you, \"*did she already have sex with another guy? Has she been cheating again?*\" This is but a taste of what it feels like being with a person that has admitted to cheating on you. It's mental torture of insecurity, paranoia and heartbreak and you'll hate every second of it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Jesus, it'd be pretty bad, so do it how you want to do it but make sure the child doesn't get punished for it. Look after your own mental health as well and don't brutalize or mentally torture your wife either.

Next year I'll be 30 years old and I have absolutely nothing to show for myself. When I was a teenager in college I was hopeful, enthusiastic, and genuinely looking forward to what life had to offer. Fast forward to today, and I'm a broken, defeated. pessimistic, negative loser who can do nothing better than hop on reddit and bitch about my pathetic life. My parents both moved out of the country when I was 20 years old, which forced me to drop out of college mid semester, find a full time job, and find a cheap apartment to live in. I found a job in the special ed field working as a counselor/mentor and luckily found a relatively cheap basement apartment and a roommate to move in with me. Fast forward 9 years and 3 different job. I'm still in the same field, although I am getting slightly higher pay (18.50/hr) and have basic health insurance. Other than that minimal progression, I haven't done jack shit with myself. I still live in the same basement apartment that I've been at for 9 years, and the scary thing is I don't know what to do to improves my circumstances. I'm not the most motivated person in the world and am pretty introverted to the point where the unknown really scares me. At the end of the work day, I come home and am absolutely wiped. I barely get 2-3 hours of relaxation time before I pass out and get ready for the next day. I've been walking a metaphorical treadmill for years with no goal or purpose set before me. I'm not particularly good at anything except for being a creative mind. I love to draw and to write fiction. I've been working on a novel series with a partner for 2+ years now, but being that our work schedules are so different, we only work on weekends, which will take us forever to get to where we want. I love fantasy, it's the one thing that's kept me sane this whole time. I basically live in a fictional world in my mind. I use TV shows, anime, and books to escape my shitty reality, and I know I should be doing something else instead, but I don't know what. My old friends from high school are mostly all married, have careers, and generally have their lives figured out, but mentally I'm still in the same place I was 10 years ago, still enjoying video games and other irrelevant shit that won't help me move forward. Thing is, it scares me how fast life has passed me by. I still talk, act, and feel like I'm 20, but the reality is i'll be turning 30 in a year and I don't even know how the fuck I got here. Granted many of my high school friends had opportunities I didn't, but I can't keep using that excuse forever. People start at nothing and eventually move on up in life. Why can't I do the same? I had a long phone conversation with my mom today, where she told me I should look into trade school in my area or think about maybe going back to school. Thing is, I've been working the last 9 years. My mentality and lifestyle isn't the same it was back then. I'm home now post work and absolutely have no energy to do anything, just the mere thought of going to school right now and doing homework/research papers again... Who the fuck has the time and energy for that shit? Apparently many people do, but I'm just not one of them. As I mentioned earlier, I am an introvert by nature.

That's the enrichment our 300 000 a year immigration (ie welfare for banks) policy gives us Writing this as I sit in traffic So why? Well listen to me you fucking peon fucks. There are two solutions. 1) cheaper debt 2) more buyers There's a slight possibility that they will let a few markets/developers slide just to show everyone they \"mean business\" and to try and prove to the world, and to themselves, that we have a \"robust\" and \"diversified\" economy built on sound foundations. But in reality there's nothing else of substance in our economy other than debt secured against house prices which are in turn inflated by that very debt. And thousands of hairdressers, baristas and imported furniture retailers taped together to look like an industry. Its fairly important that we protect these economic foundations as much as possible. The debt machine can never falter! Interest rates to be slashed again! Foreign investor restrictions to be lifted! The real unemployment rate is around 20% in terms of underemployment its even higher. Teaching grads cleaning toilets, nursing grads mowing lawns, science grads working at Big W. In 2008 the US, UK and others stopped accepting garbage students. We didn't. In fact, we and NZ opened our borders to them. They couldn't get into the US and UK, so they came here - the path of least resistance. They let in the anyone for a degree, now they let in the foreign people with the primary school visa. Next they will just let in anyone with a child here. Universities, primary schools (and high schools - they will stay) and soon Kindergardens. Why? Banks can't find fresh meat to borrow to. The men have all borrowed. Then the women have all borrowed. The final class of people who could borrow were \"students\" and third world immigrants (same Venn circle) and Aussie and NZ students who wouldn't have been let into a TAFE 30 years ago are now getting into medicine, law, engineering and arts. The banks need this fresh meat. But it's not enough because it's drying up. So now they want the kids to borrow. I see it now the kindergarden visa! All the parents, guardians and kids need to borrow money to buy a house, and get that education. The banks need it! I study economics. Most of you don't study economics.

You have no control, you fucking peons. Banks are gonna hire me, and banks are fucking king. YOU are not. Banks in Australia and NZ lend money to people for property investment, because that is how they make money. Raking in the interest payments. In order to justify current valuations, property prices (read: debt) must increase by 10% yearly, forever. The banks (read: our entire economy) therefore need property prices/debt to increase 10% yearly, forever. It's not even a question of \"risk\", the banks are absolutely reliant on something that is completely impossible except that it's not as you will see if you can read this you dummies. The banks will delay the reckoning at literally at any cost. You don't fucking count. If you did count, and you wanted it to stop, it would result in a complete rethink of our society, not to mention collapsing property prices, stock prices, pension plans. Our entire economic system now relies on using debt to inflate asset prices at a higher rate than underlying cash flows you dumb fucks. If we even try to stop this, then hundreds of thousands of people employed by banks would have to find actually productive jobs that simply no longer exist in Australia or NZ People (you and your fellow dumb fucking peon fucks) would find they own but a fraction of the wealth they thought they did, and millions would be entirely wiped out. People would be scrounging around for food, eating rats, cats, dogs, and even at those shitty greasy spoon Chinese restaurants, growing and scrounging for food everywhere they could, and resuming normal personal body weight not seen in Australia/NZ since the 1960s. Tradesmen would be struggling to put petrol in their utes, and would be begging anyone with cash to take their 5 year old ute off of their hands \u2014 no second ute and no new utes and no utes at all and no Webers and no more properties. Weekend get togethers would be devoid of talk about the number of properties people have, and how much foreign booze they drank last week, and how many European holidays they had last fucking month. And millionaire landed gentry boomers need their fucking welfare. There are about 2.5 million Australians / NZers on welfare receiving the full (or partial) Age Pension of which 2.26 million (90%) are home owners. A couple can enjoy the full Age Pension if they have assets under $286,500 and a partial pension up to $1,145,000 EXCLUDING the value of the family home. The full Age Pension for a couple if $33,500 a year without factoring in the PBS benefits, discounted rates and utilities, discounted car registration and so on. The bottom line? The political-majority is enormously incentivized to remain in the houses on quarter-acre blocks they bought 20/30/40/50 years ago for < 3x annual income. They have no reason to sell up and downsize to release equity to generate income or reverse mortgage their homes. Do not underestimate the effect this has on supply availability and prices.

Here is the letter: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dear Mojang, [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am /u/ImJustaBagofHammers, a devoted fan of your game and active player on the official Minecraft of the subreddit that your own founder - who, if you are reading this message, most likely sent it to you - moderates. Though you have probably not heard of me, I have found it necessary to type this letter. I have been an avid admirer of and participant in your game, Minecraft, for many years. I have made great memories and developed useful skills in my escapades on both my singleplayer worlds and on various servers. I have played and made adventures maps. I was a devoted follower of many of the classic Minecraft YouTubers. I give sole credit to this game for my interest in engineering and in applied physics. It is because of the devotion of people such as myself that your game became the most successful the world has ever seen. Indeed, it is because I appreciate your game that I am so greatly distressed by its current direction, specifically by how it exposes your hypocrisy, apathy, unethical and potentially even illegal behavior, and contempt for the Minecraft community. To illustrate this point, I really could analyze any recent update, but I've decided to focus on 1.14 in particular. Though this letter's structure may seem disorganized, and its contents irrelevant, I hope that it, harnessing your piercing intellects, will be able to illuminate the problems of such aspects of the current state of your game as those of you who still have consciences have ignored. I will of course not comment on every last change or addition made in the update, and I will barely acknowledge the positive changes because, frankly, they are almost all very subtle and long overdue. Now, without adieu: [linebreak]  [linebreak] Playing through the latest update, I was struck by your hypocritical design philosophy. I noticed two particular examples of this; I will begin with the more benign (which I feel is probably the result of apathy), and then discuss the far more sinister one. The more harmless example is the new stonecutter block, whose model features a sawblade. You have rejected many suggested features (rightly, in my opinion), such as mining hats, for \"not fitting with the Medieval theme of Minecraft\". Why then did you add this? However, this issue is massively overshadowed by another; a new mob you added to the game is the fox. As an ambient mob, I quite like the fox. That said, I strongly object to the ability to take foxes. Foxes are frequently kept as pets, which causes them to live out depressing and anxious lives, as they, of course, are not domesticated animals. Why would you encourage children and even clueless adults to participate in this incredibly inhumane enterprise, especially considering that you yourselves removed the ability to tame parrots by feeding them cookies out of a concern for the wellbeing of parrots, and in this very update removed polar bears from the list of mobs required for the monsters hunted advancement? I can assume only that you have some financial interest in promoting the wild fox pet trade, which, if true, is quite disappointing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The new update makes many changes to villagers and villagers, both by redesigning villagers and by adding a new mob: the pillager. As you are without a doubt aware of the changes, I will not bother to list them all here. I appreciate many of the quality-of-life changes to villagers, and I can tolerate the changes to villager profession selection (though it complicates some of my challenge maps); I take issue only with the changes to villager appearance. I admit that my objections are not wholly rational, but I wish there they retained their classic appearance in at least one biome. At any rate, the other visual changes surpass them in both consequence and malice. With regard to villagers, I take greater issue with pillagers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I must admit that pillagers seem halfhearted. From the beginning, I was skeptical of \"raider villagers\", but I thought the idea might work as long as the raids didn't happen automatically without possibility of prevention (and indeed, they do not). However, I think there was a missed opportunity to make pillagers a new kind of villager rather than a new kind of illager. If they were villagers, they would be neutral to the player by default and players would potentially have the ability to ally themselves with them. In this case, they would also be mutually-hostile with zombies. You might say that you couldn't promote raiding in a children's game, but by the very design of Minecraft, the player is able to do heinously evil things; for example, it is possible to directly burn child villagers to death if you like. Therefore, I don't see how joining raider gangs would be much worse. You could even make the gangs take over settlements instead of indiscriminately slaughtering everyone (except the children, who can prolong a raid by several minutes as the pillagers wait for them to grow up so they can kill them, which could have been solved if you made them kidnap to raise them as pillagers) make it seem better. As it stands now, however, pillagers are simply a new enemy. While adding new enemies isn't inherently bad, I feel you could have done more. Lastly, it should be possible to exterminate pillagers from an area. Pillager patrols should spawn only if there is an active outpost in the area, and the pillagers in an outpost should have to rebuild their population by breeding or by raising kidnapped baby villagers. In the current version of your game, there is no way to eliminate organized crime if you try to create a civilization encompassing multiple settlements, and, since pillagers are automatically hostile, no way to travel without being attacked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In addition to these things, you've added a new villager-like mob; the wandering trader. Though I admire its advanced AI and complex behavior, it should not have been added to the game. All it does is sell the player biome-specific items, which, since it always spawns near a player, eliminates the incentive to explore, a major and lauded feature of your game. I cannot imagine you really thought this would \"help\" players who didn't want to explore for resources; creative mode and commands exist for that. The only way it could conceivably be useful is on a large anarchy server where all resources within large areas have been depleted. However, because it always spawns next to a player, and there is a cap of one per world at a specific time, most players will never see it on a large server. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now I would like to briefly comment on another new mob: the panda. I would find it quite peculiar that you spent valuable time making them one of the most complex mobs in the history of the game, having sets of alleles that combine to manifest as varying phenotypes, when they have practically no function, the only practical function, so far as I can see, is collecting slimeballs in peaceful difficulty (baby pandas sometimes sneeze in a reference to the long-dead internet meme and drop slimeballs as a result). However, I do not, for I believe I have the depressing answer; the People's Republic of China. You would be far from the first corporation to pander to China at the cost of the immediate value of your own property. The PRC is infamous for its use of \"panda diplomacy\" to improve its international image; I have to wonder if they worked out an arrangement with to ease their restrictions on Minecraft (which isn't outright illegal) in exchange with cooperation with this agenda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The previous supporting paragraphs have avoiding directly addressing one of the most controversial and damning elements of the new update; the texture changes. In this paragraph, I will address it, along with another, comparatively minor, change. To the shock of many, you took it upon yourselves to completely redesign every last texture in the game (except for that of the creeper, which is preserved for being \"iconic\"). Yes, you did not make them the default (though you plan to from the next update onward), and currently have no public intention of making them mandatory without mods. Nevertheless, they are a window into your future plans for the game. It is obvious what you hope to achieve by changing the textures (with seemingly no support) from their iconic classic designs (which is so ubiquitous that most people can probably picture them in their head on command) to generic ones that, if I may be honest, make Minecraft look like a free-to-play mobile knockoff of itself. You want to make Minecraft into a bland, mobile-style game that any five-year old can pick up and play with for hours doing nothing of value. If the game's character, colored with the heart and soul poured into by its creators and which reflects the neurodiverse individuals who finally found an outlet in it, must die for this, then so be it. When you have had your way, Minecraft will no longer by a life-redefining experience that inspires those pushed to the edge by society to achieve greatness, it will no longer by a game in which thousands make creative and challenging puzzles and adventures for everyone to enjoy, it will no longer be a game that inspires artists and engineers; it will be game where children build models of penis out of TNT and laugh as they blow them up. To this end, you have redesigned the textures, simplified the game, and even changed the dye system, because usually ground-up bones for white dye apparently gave the game too much personality. You have made your contempt for the neurodiverse no secret; you even condescendingly renamed the classic textures to \"programmer art\". Its blatancy would be laughable if it wasn't so appalling. [linebreak]  [linebreak] With all that said, I should stress that your game is not beyond saving. If you wish to take my advice to heart, you must remove the sawblade from the stonecutter's texture and the ability to tame foxes (but may keep them as an ambient mob), make player-pillager relations more dynamic, remove the wandering trader, cut any illicit ties you may have formed with repressive regimes, and, last but not least, reverse the trend of \"simplifying\" the game.

That's correct.\"(September 13)* )Bush is at this point aware that there is some sort of coup effort going on; for example, all the reporter's onboard AF1 are required to turn their cellphones off because they are worried about the attacking faction tracking cell signals - a capability we can all agree is well beyond that of al-Qaeda. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So Bush is under threat from people with high level insider knowledge. Press secretary acknowledged all this on national TV the day after (Angel is next being called in). Bush diverts to Barksdale which is basically the #2 nuclear command site. After a couple hours there he proceeds to Offutt, which is the #1 nuclear command site. You should also be aware of a variety of drills running on the day of 9/11, Vigilant Guardian. This is a full scale mock up of nuclear war; the whole infrastructure is activated for first strike (incidentally, part of the Vigilant Guardian drill in 2001 included a hijacking of planes as the instigator of the conflict). So what is Bush doing going to Barksdale and Offutt? Clearly trying to bring the nuclear forces to heel in light of learning of high level insider power plays. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >This might be starting to sound a bit over the top - high level insiders seizing control of nuclear infrastructure and threatening the president with it. But only a few years later we have a similar incident in 2007 as 6 nuclear weapons are seized, generally regarded as intended for use starting the war in either Iran or Georgia. Later, in 2013, we again have nukes going off base unauthorized. Hours after it was reported in the media Sen. Graham is on TV warning of a nuke hit on South Carolina to be blamed on Syrian rebels; two of top nuclear commanders get dismissed in the following weeks. So high level insider fighting over the nuclear arsenal is pretty standard stuff, well known to the public. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >With the question of a struggle over the nuclear arsenal now being common sense rather than shocking, we consider Bush caving to the terrorism line and starting the whole war on terror. You have Putin immediately backing off the seizure of assets in Russia. It won't be until the last couple of years that Putin resumes his assertion of authority over Russia; the US responds in kind with attacks on Syria and Ukraine but Russia has since quietly updated it's missile program and is prepared for nuclear war this time around; you now see a defiant Putin in the face of the 9/11 coup faction. Alongside this remarkable shift in geopolitics, there is an emerging anti-dollar block with the BRIC countries establishing an infrastructure bank last year. Just weeks ago, Glazyev announced this and is widely regarded as being the mouth of Putin; he organized the recent gas deal with Chin for example. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So you see 9/11 was a pivotal event used to extend the US dollar empire under threat of nuclear war for another 10-15 years in the face of an assertive Putin back in 2001 and growing domestic problems for the US Government. (You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended) [linebreak]  [linebreak] >So now that broad outline of purpose and motivation for 9/11 is clear, it's easier to come to terms with what your eyes tell you looking at Building 7 implode into its foot print at free fall for example. You don't even necessarily have to view it as an evil thing; the US people are quite severely fucked without something being done to backstop the US dollar.

America has been in absolute decline since women were included in politics. The feminization of everything has left young males with no outlet for their undeveloped minds and bodies to release anger. Eventually video games about shooting up airports and films about shooting up <insert America's enemy of the week> is not enough and that rage presents itself with massacres at elementary schools.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] You now have 6000.", "hatespeech"], ["[linebreak]  [linebreak] TRUE! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The other laowai had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I simply loathed the other aowai. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. It was none of these, no qualm had I with him. It was the changes in everyone else!  I was no longer getting the stares I used to, my students don't say I'm handsome anymore, the jianbingguozi ayi no longer skip the chilli sauce for me and even the milf at the massage parlor don't give me discount for happy ending anymore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the laowai than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it --oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the other laowai's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously \u2013I furiously dafeijied to the dick pics he had sent to Rainy on his Waysheen. And this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the other laowai who vexed me, but rather the attention he had diverted from me. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound laowai, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I dafeijeed to all his indecent photographs he thought privately sent to Rainy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the Happy Giraffe saved countless fortune by giving us apartments without windows,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had my head in, and was about to open the flashlight on my CoolPad, when my thumb slipped upon the Meipai app, creating a very \"meng\" selfie, but also setting off the camera flash, and the other laowai sprang up in bed, crying out --\"Who's there?\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. Feeling my shohwdeedee fill with blood in anticipation of the pictures he had sent to Rainy tonight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of readying his member for dick pics. It was not a groan of pain or of delight --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with the need to hear 'Wa! So big!\". I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the other laowai felt, and envied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. He had been saying to himself --\"It is not impotence, it is merely the 4 yuan baijiu I had for dinner,\" or \"I am just nervous about AIDS since I fingered a prostitute.\" Yes, he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel the presence of my head within the room. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little \u2013covered the CoolPad flashlight with my finger. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the other laowai's pale litter bit fat belly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness --all a dull grayish white, freckled with what must have been acne, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old other laowai's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.", "hatespeech"], ["And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over-acuteness of the sense? --now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the litter bit fat doozi. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The other laowai's terror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The other laowai's xiaoshi had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the CoolPad flashlight and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The laowai was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eve would trouble me no more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I then carefully an meticulously put each of the pieces inside the empty Chamion Pizza dlivery boxes littering the floor. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered three jingcha shooshoo, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity.. An elderly neighbor, a former Red Guard, who was faemers in the neighborhood for throwing eggs at monks and smashing a Yuan Dynasty Buddha carving had reported that a laowai lived next to them, and that the police should see if they are spies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I smiled, --for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The laowai, I mentioned, hway low jyah luh. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search --search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, put a maidanglow bag on top of the pizza boxes and nongfu quan bottles filled with my urine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now --again! --hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"Villains!\" I shrieked, \"dissemble no more!

Let's talk about them in a very specific and personal way. Here's the story: ImJustaBagofHammers sees itself as a postmodern equivalent of Marx's proletariat, revolutionizing the world by wresting it from its oppressors (viz., those who increase awareness and understanding of our similarities and differences). For some odd reason, ImJustaBagofHammers believes that laws are meant to be broken. Its unasinous aides-de-camp, who believe likewise, also fail to see that the feudalism \"debate\" is not a debate. It is a harangue, a politically motivated, brilliantly publicized, irrational attack on progressive ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ImJustaBagofHammers wonders why everyone hates it. Apparently, it never stopped to think that maybe it's because it's easy enough to hate it any day of the week on general principles. But now I'll tell you about some very specific things that it is up to, things that ought to make a real ImJustaBagofHammers-hater out of you. First off, I'm not asking whether its verbalisms are valid or whether they have any application to current topics of theoretical and political importance. I'm asking only the following specific question: Is it possible for those who defend morally questionable imperialism to make their defense look more raffish than it currently is? This isn't such an easy question to answer, but let me take a stab at it: ImJustaBagofHammers's soliloquies have kept us separated for too long from the love, contributions, and challenges of our brothers and sisters in this wonderful adventure we share together\u2014life! I would inarguably not have thought it possible that ImJustaBagofHammers gained ascendancy through monstrous abuse of its foot soldiers, but it's true. How did ImJustaBagofHammers get so yellow-bellied? I have my theories, but they're only speculation. At any rate, an understanding of the damage that may be caused by its swinish rejoinders isn't something I expect everyone to develop the first time they hear about it. That's why I write over and over again and from so many different angles about how ImJustaBagofHammers has stated that its ruses epitomize wholesome family entertainment. I find such declaratory statements quite telling. They tell me that I'm no psychiatrist. Still, from the little I know about psychiatry I can undeniably say that ImJustaBagofHammers seems to exhibit many of the symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. I don't say that to judge but merely to put ImJustaBagofHammers's rebarbative philosophies into perspective. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The sad truth is that our nation is infected with the poisons of nepotism, stoicism, and xenophobia. And the sadder truth is that those poisons have been fed, watered, fertilized, and fostered by ImJustaBagofHammers and its claque. On that note, let me say that I defy the insolent, petty ogres who ridicule the accomplishments of generations of great men and women, and I defy the powers of darkness that they represent. ImJustaBagofHammers exhibits signs of arrested development, don't you think? What I'm trying to say is that ImJustaBagofHammers's rummy, brown-nosing ideologies are meticulously designed to keep the population unaware, uneducated, dumbed down, and focused on stupefying activities like video games. The intention is to prevent people from noticing that ImJustaBagofHammers has been funding, assembling, and training alabandical whiners to shove us towards an absolute state of vassalage. Some people have said that ImJustaBagofHammers's record of truth-telling is, shall we say, less than a hundred percent. Maybe. But I'm more inclined to believe that I unequivocally dislike ImJustaBagofHammers. Likes or dislikes, however, are irrelevant to observed facts, such as that ImJustaBagofHammers has the nerve to call those of us who follow through on the critical work that has already begun \"conspiracy theorists\". No, we're \"conspiracy revealers\" because we reveal that ImJustaBagofHammers has quite a clever technique for concealing its intent to make us the helpless puppets of our demographic labels. Specifically, its technique is to delve into philological discussions about comparative abstractive norms whenever the conversation veers too close towards revealing that its vassals have repeatedly been caught making people suspicious of those who speak the truth. I had expected better from ImJustaBagofHammers and its vaunted loony-bin crew, but then again, it keeps trying to expose and neutralize its detractors rather than sit at the same table and negotiate. And if we don't remain eternally vigilant, it will honestly succeed. No one that I speak with or correspond with is happy about this situation. Of course, I don't speak or correspond with repulsive criminal masterminds, ImJustaBagofHammers's confederates, or anyone else who fails to realize that knowledge is the key that unlocks the shackles of bondage. That's why it's important for you to know that ImJustaBagofHammers must be surrounded by some sort of reality-distortion field. Why else would its encomiasts claim that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative? If it weren't for all that reality distortion they'd instead be observing that ImJustaBagofHammers's tricks have merged with frotteurism in several interesting ways. Both spring from the same kind of reality-denying mentality. Both condone universal oppression. And both hijack our educational system and turn it into a self-cloning propaganda machine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > I recently heard some encouraging news. It appears that ImJustaBagofHammers's ongoing campaign to create a new cottage industry around its vindictive form of desperadoism has been meeting some opposition. Apparently, not everyone wants ImJustaBagofHammers to undermine the intellectual purpose of higher education. Rather, an increasing number of people have come to realize that it seems to have recently added the word \"hyperphosphorescence\" to its otherwise simplistic vocabulary. I suppose ImJustaBagofHammers intends to use big words like that to obscure the fact that the very genesis of its moonstruck biases is in Bonapartism. And it seems to me to be a neat bit of historic justice that ImJustaBagofHammers will eventually itself be destroyed by Bonapartism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Although unbiased journalism died long ago, I'm pleased to find at least some minimal reporting of how I, unlike ImJustaBagofHammers, refuse to beat plowshares into swords. That represents yet more evidence\u2014as if we needed more\u2014that I shall not argue that ImJustaBagofHammers's newsgroup postings are an authentic map of its plan to expose and punish individuals who do not conform to its philosophies or beliefs. Read them and see for yourself. Out of the vast number of devastating evils for which hypocritical gomerals are directly or indirectly responsible, I shall pick out only a single one which is most in keeping with the inner essence of ImJustaBagofHammers's politically incorrect, ultra-putrid canards: paternalism. I am indeed annoyed with ImJustaBagofHammers's insistence that views not informed by radical critique implicitly promote hegemonic values. Sorry, ImJustaBagofHammers, but that's not a fact. That's intellectual dishonesty bordering on lunacy. If ImJustaBagofHammers wanted to speak the truth, it should have said that a recent United Nations report on human-rights abuses found that it acts with animus against those who expurgate sectarianism in all its forms from our humble community. The devastating findings of this report should not be ignored. In particular, I want to highlight the report's observation that ImJustaBagofHammers finds it convenient to blame all of society's woes on deplorable undesirables. Doing so fits with the rest of its populist sloganeering and takes less intellectual effort than investigating the structural factors and material practices that may in fact be the true reason that just as night follows day, ImJustaBagofHammers will mold your mind and have you see the world not as it is but as it wants you to see it before you know it.

I'm sure that if these [dignified souls who belonged to the Octagenarian Society in 1929](https://youtu.be/0FE30a4J38Q) (YouTube video) would be able to get into a time capsule and have tea with the yuppies of today, they'd really want to set them straight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, specifically about this 17 year old girl. In my last comment, I pointed out that it is a legally arguable case that the state of the Netherlands took this girl's life. The policies of that nation need to be changed, now. And, personally, I would argue the proposition that the premises under which it was done might be based on bad social and psychological science. Twenty years ago I stepped into a local city library and was very curious to read an article in the psychology magazine about the Rind Report. This was a study which established that people are generally NOT emotionally scarred by instances of molestation in their childhood.The furor of legislators in Washington DC was so strong (understand that the Christian Right had just experienced a decade of growth and had become a powerful political force). Capitol Hill censured the scientists who produced that report.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now, just think. A society which prevents scientists from doing their work in a fair-minded way  in respect to the observations that they make is shooting itself in the foot. That's our USA which did this, not some third world banana republic. But recently, with masses of people who don't believe the facts that experts such as Robert Mueller gather, because of a propaganda organization that has standing as a news agency, the US is starting to look more and more like a banana republic, isn't it?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There needs to be firm separation between government and academia, just as there needs to be one between religion and government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nations and peoples can only reject science and its research at their peril. And I wouldn't say that they suffer the judgement of God for this, like the people of the Octagenarian Society back in 1929 might have, but there are natural consequences. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We should all be sad that the government of Netherlands thinks that it's OK to kill a child because of some weird fad of pop psychology that has taken root in the halls of Western academia. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's a shocking abuse of human rights, and **action needs to be taken NOW**,  and yes, for the sake of the children.
