Back in the day it was the fantasy childhood sweet hearts. We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just \"get closer\" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR:  My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me.

This is what gives us stuff like Pok\u00e9mon Let's Go, which were considered very lackluster remakes with less effort put in them than the remakes that were released over ten years before and what also makes us buy games that are no more than beta versions, since DLC/complete versions come out the year later.

There are remakes/remasters that are really good to introduce a new generation to a certain game (Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red/Leaf Green, The 3DS Zelda remasters), but there is a growing trend of remakes/remasters/complete edtions that are basically just to profit as much as they can off one game without altering it much.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Nowadays, I often act against my own interests solely out of fear. For example: some weeks ago, I messaged a girl I had been texting for around a month (I don't know if I like her as a friend & it's just my mind playing tricks on me because of my inexperience or if I actually like her romantically) at around 3 am and since I didn't get an answer half an hour later I decided to pop some sleeping pills and head to bed.

Even though I really wanted to see her. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My lack of social skills angers me. I know I would've done the exact same thing if I hadn't gone to bed before her reply. Why? Because I fear that my awkwardness would drive her away. Especially at a nightclub (only went three times to one, none of them were 'successful' nights at all). The beach was also a terrifying idea because in addition to having zero social skills, I'm not happy with my body at all. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not that I'm an introvert. Socializing tends to make me happier and more energetic for the rest of the day. It kills me when I find something funny on the internet and I have no one to share it with. Or when I want to go to the movies or something and I have no one to go with. I dislike being by myself most of the time. I'd love to have a group of friends to go out and have fun with. Or even go on vacations with, like some do. But since I tend to bore people on one-on-one conversations and I usually get kind of ignored when in a group, it looks like an unattainable goal.

The Duggar family had a reality television show called \\*19 Kids and Counting\\*, which ended due to backlash when it was discovered that the oldest son molested four of the sisters.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Based on my own personal experience and other posts I've seen, I would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the OP for venting views they do not like. I get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and I'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. I've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. However, far too often do I notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. Not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. I suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. Attack the argument, not the person. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like \"you're not really X\" or \"you're fake and a troll\". That's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. It's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. It's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. For example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. Is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? If they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. It's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that OffMyChest wouldn't allow, I would expect better of people here. I dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that OffMyChest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views.

I am now currently a sophomore year going into junior year. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I grew up with engineering drilled into my brain. My dad is an engineer, and as a little kid I always solve problems, create new objects with lego pieces, and always wondered how cars work. I excelled in many math and science tests until starting middle school when I moved into a bit more average. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I then entered a top tier engineering school under an engineering program. I quickly realized how much I hated chemistry and barely scrapped by with a D in both Calculus 3 (Taylor series, sequences, etc...) and chemistry II, got into academic probation. I then switched into another form of engineering, bumped my GPA up with easy classes just to get out of academic probation, then got into academic probation again after failing Statics with a F. I honestly feel very annoyed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm now sitting in my house during spring break thinking Engineering isn't right for me. I literally have no drive to do well in classes anymore. I hate going back to school, rather irritated each time I have to go back. I hate the constant going to class, sitting in there listening to pointless bullshit, then getting out. I hate the constant homework that is being thrown at me. The thing I hate most? Tests. Why do we have to memorize all of pointless math and others? I don't know which other major I can be interested at. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Most people I'm around with are rather shitty, or I just don't fit in with them. I am losing multiple friends back in home, and I'm not making any true friends in college. I'm always open to hanging out, but it's always like this: \"I'm busy, sorry.\" Or some version of that. Or they just don't respond at all. I always have nothing to do rather than playing video games instead of seeing all other people going to college parties with their super close group of friends. I also got made fun of for driving a manual transmission vehicle that I bought, because it was cheap and reliable, but at least I have a freaking car to use, right? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why do I have to be that kid who peaked in high school? Back then when I had a girlfriend, was a sports team captain, always have fun stuff to do. Now I'm just sitting here with a low GPA and have not exercised in so long because of engineering work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm fucking irritated. I've been noticing I got angry a lot easier, especially after getting back test scores when all I want to do is to yell \"FUCK ENGINEERING\" in my brain. Why can't I just get my shit together? I hate being one of the least smartest students in class, but I loathe almost every single math and science courses I take. I loathe calculus and linear analysis. I loathe all physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did I let GPA dictate my happiness? And otherwise, why the hell do most jobs have this 3.0 GPA minimum required?

[linebreak]  [linebreak] First time getting high: Grade 10, at lunch time. I couldnt walk, couldnt stand, barely could speak and sat in the woods for little over 4hours. I was generally afraid for my life and was listening to christian music thinking I was going to die. Finally some chick came over and helped me get home which I fellasleep and felt super exhausted when I woke up. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second big high: Smoked with a lot of friends and played Fortnite, generally felt pretty good. I could only focus on one thing however, but when I focused on it I felt like I could really understand it. We were listening to music and I felt my ears could feel the beat in them (Like the Trap Nation logo in their videos but in my ears). If I rubbed my arms I could feel that same feeling over and over again even though I stopped doing it. Felt like my heart was pumping very fast and I was biting down hard on my teeth. I came to the conclusion that what I'm feeling is from the high, almost like a lucid high (??) Like I was awareness what I was feeling was from a high and I could control my high because I control my brain. If I opened my mouth I could still feel the feeling of my clenching my jaw, if I stopped putting my hand over my heart I could still feel my heart pounding. I could stop and continue effects, almost like I was coding my brain to stop and start whatever I wanted to do. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Last big high and last time smoking (2 weeks ago): 16% thc prerolls I bought at the liquor store, couldnt even finish the whole joint, got half way before I threw it out. I had to find an activity I could do because if I kept to myself I felt like I would get lost in my mind and eventually die. It felt like I was connecting all the dots to life, I had to snap myself out of thinking too much because it made me want to fallasleep and at the time falling asleep = death. I had to keep my mind away of thinking about my high, if I thought about it my heart felt like it would speed up, like a wheel and it would get faster and faster and then eventually it felt like someone was whipping my consicous, I'd think about something and then I'd hear the crack of a whip and the thought would be gone. I felt like my sober self was fighting my high self to see who could keep conscious and it was exhausting. I had to keep throwing out thoughts because I'd spiral farther down and couldnt stop myself. I tried watching Brooklyn 99 but I kep imagining my life as a movie, and what would someones reaction would be to what I was doing right now, then I'd imagine my reaction to me thinking about my life as a movie and the cycle would continue. I tried taking a shower but it felt too good and relaxing, It felt like my legs were telling my brain that they were done standing and going to give out soon. Overall it was like each part of my body was its own body and they all were trying to communicate at the same time. Then I decided to play Fortnite and LoL, first couple of games were rough but then I decided that if I control my brain I'll force myself to get into the perfect state of mind to play, so I did. Just thinking about the right state of mind allowed me to get in it, and I played the best I've ever played in my life.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] What are my theories? I must be triggering some receptor or something in my brain that causes a episode. But I also think that while I'm high I control more of my brain because the thc receptors in my brain is filled up rather than being empty normally (if thats how it works). I generally believe that I can overdose on marijuana, and I want to get my brain checked out while I'm high, I'm fine with being the first person to OD on marijuana if it furthers the research.

The first website I visited was TheForce.Net; the second was a porn site. I'd already discovered masturbation a year prior but unfettered web access blew the doors off the whole fucking thing. As a shy and introverted kid, who'd been relentlessly teased by girls in middle school and junior high and had learned to fear them, and who was now going to an all boys high school, it was a godsend for my raging, gooey hormones. I didn't have to worry about girls anymore! Everything I knew about naked girls in my teenage years, I learned from the internet. It felt like the perfect \u2014 and safe \u2014 release valve. It was also a prime enabler of avoidance of girls, and of never needing to confront the reality that not all girls were going to make fun of me. My grades never suffered, and I did have friends, but I was pretty well in the internet porn bubble by 15. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Around then, my porn tastes had expanded from merely jacking to pictures of naked women and low quality video clips to reading erotica. Lots of it. Literotica was a wonderland for me. I also got to indulge my curiosity in gay porn, and I found the sheer novelty of it to be breathtakingly exciting. I mixed it in with all the opposite-sex porn I was consuming I began a long period of questioning my sexuality, even though being surrounded by guys all day, I never felt attracted or infatuated to a single one of them. It never occurred to me at 16 and 17 that I was responding to the novelty and the taboo of watching gay porn, and that it did not align with my own sexual preferences. Soon after I graduated from high school, I decided to put it to the test \u2014 I found a guy my age who lived nearby, and I actually lost my virginity to him. It did not do a damn thing for me, and I came away confident that I wasn't gay, but the porn consumption continued.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I didn't date at all from 17 to 20. I'd had my first girlfriend during high school and it was very exciting in a physical sense, thereby proving that I was still very much attracted to girls, but that had long since ended and I retreated into my shell of depression/anxiety and enough porn to suffocate a lesser man. High speed internet had come into our home, so now there was more porn, and it was *faster!* Now there were streaming sites; Xtube was an early favorite of mine. It was so comforting and reliable, and it never made me feel anxious; ashamed, but never anxious.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I starting dating my first real girlfriend when I was 20, and she was the first time I'd ever had sex with a woman, and the first time I'd had sex at all since that one guy I'd experimented with. I enjoyed sex with her but was still pretty anxious and inhibited about not living up to the dudes I'd watched in pornos, both professional and amateur. This led to a lot of performance anxiety, and using masturbation as a self-soothing mechanism, it gave rise to erectile dysfunction as well. Erectile dysfunction at 21 years old. Can you fucking believe it? It was a source of tension in the relationship, amongst other things \u2014 namely my untreated anxiety and depression, which I didn't want to accept and face. My porn consumption bothered her as well. Long story short, we lasted two years before the entire relationship deteriorated. This did nothing to improve my self-esteem. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next decade, I went on a ton of first dates that went nowhere, and had a handful of one-night stands where I could force myself to perform (at least) adequately. Entire days, nights, and weekends would be consumed by porn \u2014 streaming videos, pictures, literary erotica, and once I found Reddit, a ton of the gonewild-type subs. I'd be masturbating four or five times a day when I was alone. It would leave me feeling drained and utterly revolted by myself. My socialization dropped like a rock as a result of intense anxiety, and the excessive masturbation was being used as an avoidance mechanism to hold the anxiety at bay. It was all a terribly dysfunctional cycle.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A few months ago, the woman of my dreams, whom I'd been dating for over a year, left me for reasons unrelated to my masturbation habits. It broke me, and I'm now finally getting therapy for the anxiety that has held my life in a death grip since adolescence. And now, it's time to leave masturbation behind too. I've masturbated five times in the last twenty-four hours due to obvious anxiety issues and I cannot stand it anymore. I'm feeling disgusted and ashamed of myself for the last time. I'm going to get better, and goddammit I'm going to pursue the type of life and relationships I deserve. This cannot be anymore. My life cannot be crippled by anxiety and its toxic coping mechanisms any longer. No more porn. No more gonewild subs. No nothing.

We rarely argue, we share very similar mindsets and interests, but the smaller differences are starting to affect me. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can say that she could be my future wife if she dropped a few habits, but I honestly don't see her doing so. She smokes cigarettes and does a lot of recreational drugs; cannabis, mdma, psychedelics, and has recently been interested in dmt. She has mild depression, diagnosed anxiety, and doesn't have any hobbies. Because she doesn't have any hobbies, she is always smoking marijuana daily, and she is always looking for the next opportunity to do mdma(once every few months) and I feel like her life is revolving around recreational drugs, albeit this is not heavy usage, purely to pass time. She is obsessed with having children and more pets, but at times her depression leads to neglect her current pets. She is insistent on having children in the future, but I can easily see the drug habits and depression affecting the well-being of her child and any future pets she wants to adopt. She does not see her drug problem as an issue, and says that she has the will to quit of necessary, but I don't believe her because I have seen how low her depression can pull her down. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for some background on myself, I'm a quiet introvert with a lot of hobbies, stable job with a mortgage, I occupy my time with various things, like home improvement, computer games and watching netflix. I also have a lot of creative art hobbies that I do from time to time. My view on recreational drugs is quite lax, I am aware that they do have inherent health risks and toxicity but this isn't the sub to discuss that. What I am willing to say is that I also enjoy recreational drugs from time to time, but I'd prefer it to be less frequent, and for it to not be the main focus of an activity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Since being with my girlfriend, my drug usage has increased, and often times we will resort to smoking weed just to pass time. There is also a heavy expectation on me to sort out activities and entertainment for any given weekday, and she will complain loudly if not occupied. This will often default back to smoking more cannabis, which I'm not the greatest fan of.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have suggested many times for her to adopt a hobby, but she dismisses this and continues to occupy her time with drugs, when I try to push the matter, she will need to smoke cigarettes to alleviate her stress. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I honestly love my girlfriend, and I can see us staying together indefinitely if we stay on a similar path, but her insistence of a child conflicts with her cigarette and drug use. I would have no issues with her lifestyle if she didn't want a child; but as she is so clucky and unwilling to care for herself,  I feel that any child brought into this world will be in danger. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really don't know how to approach the matter, and I have been thinking about this for the longest time. I can't see her using less drugs, changing her mind about having a child, or picking up hobbies to occupy her time, and this is a major hurdle in our relationship. I can see us being best friends, and her having a child with another person, but I would still worry about the welfare of the kid, and breaking up and remaining mutual friends is always an idealistic situation that rarely works out.

This was their cottage, and their children and grandchildren were able to go up any time they wanted in the summer. And we did.

The big dock, the kayaks, the boat the grandkids could use whenever they wanted, the cool water, the beautiful sunsets, this place was heaven.

And then my aunt and uncle decided to buy it. They promised everyone nothing would change, we could all go up whenever we wanted, etc. But that wasn't realistic. Their kids, my cousins, have first dibs when it comes to going up. If their kids bring friends, there's no room for the other 2 families. If my aunt and uncle bring their friends, same thing applies.

Who's up for some context?! [linebreak]  [linebreak] This started a few years ago, when I was big into writing fanfic - something I'm trying to get myself back into eventually. I write for a fairly niche fandom; it's not *small,* but it's also not terribly active these days, either. I'd made a few acquaintances through it, either way. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of these was a woman roughly my age - let's call her \"Jill.\" We kind of hit it off, being active and discussing the series on one of the message boards; we liked and left feedback on each others' stories, chatted a bit in private. We bonded over personal stuff, a bit, too. And for the curious, this was a platonic thing - I'm a gay guy, she's a straight(?) married woman. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyway, we wind up being friends on Facebook, and I think that may be where the trouble started. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is... I know what it's like to *be* clingy. I've had to deal with the fallout from it in the past, and it's something I've really tried to work on, something I get very self-conscious about whenever I make a new friend. In the past, I've had friends who would say nothing about it until they reached a breaking point, and then they'd be pretty harsh about it when the dam finally broke. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The point of this is that... Jill was quite clingy herself. It came about pretty quickly after a certain point. Like, within less than half a year of our knowing each other. [linebreak]  [linebreak] She knew my working hours, but she'd constantly message me to talk when she knew I'd be sleeping, or getting ready to go to work, or *at* work. Or when she knew I was trying to take time to myself to do something else - gaming, writing, whatever. Sometimes I'd talk a bit, or tell her I'd talk to her later when I had a chance (like if I needed to get ready for work, or bed, or something). If we went more than a few days without talking too much, regardless of the reason, she'd kind of guilt trip me over it. \"I missed talking to you,\" \"It feels like it's been so long since we talked,\" et cetera... mind that it was generally maybe 3 or 4 days at most between conversations. She'd also get down on herself, and I can't tell if she was being manipulative or what. \"I know I'm probably boring/annoying/not much fun to talk to. I'm a wreck.\" Things like that. I don't know how to respond to stuff like that other than just \"No you're not\" or whatever. I'm not good with that stuff. She knew that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I did try to be tactful and point out to Jill - more than once - that while I enjoyed talking to her, hey, I had to sleep, or work, or get ready for work, and I had other stuff I needed to get done. I didn't want to outright *say* \"You know I have a life outside of you, right?\", but then again... maybe I should've? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Either way, she kinda ramped it up. Asking for my address so she could send me stuff I'd mentioned offhand (I mentioned in a Facebook post that I was gonna save up to buy a keyboard, she offered to send me one if I'd give her my address - and it was at a point where I wasn't comfortable with the idea). Trying to find new excuses to strike up conversation (\"I had a dream that something terrible happened to you, so message me when you get this, because I get freaked out over stuff like that\") even though we'd spoken only a day or two ago. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Eventually, I got tired of Jill not getting it, and got so uncomfortable with her and her clinginess persisting despite my stated discomfort with it, that I ghosted her. Blocked her on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net), blocked her on Facebook, on my phone. I was getting really stressed out from dealing with her. And maybe I should've been more sympathetic, because I'd been her before. I'd been that person whose co-dependent nature pushed people away. But even seeing a notification from her stressed me out majorly. She seemed to want me to be her therapist (never mind I have a ton of my own issues to deal with), to be on-call for her when she was lonely (never mind that she has a husband she seems to love deeply and was always praising him), and so on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Apparently, after I ghosted her, Jill took it pretty hard for a while. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is... this was over a year ago. You'd think she'd have maybe moved on a little since then, yeah? She has other friends, as far as I know, that she really gets along with well, too. She seems more social. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Except, last week, another writer we were both friends with (I'll call her \"Claire\") PMed me on [Fanfiction.net](https://Fanfiction.net). Mostly to say hi, let me know a new game was coming out in the series that we all wrote for, that she was excited and all that. We weren't all that close, but she'd message me periodically to chat. I respond, say \"hey, Claire, I'm excited too, sorry I've been so quiet lately but I had a lot to deal with recently, hope to get back to writing soon.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] She responds, says she hopes so too, and also, \"Hey, why don't you drop Jill a line? She's really missed you this past year.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, apparently, Jill still doesn't get that I'm not comfortable talking to her, and despite my pointing it out multiple times, she doesn't get that I wanted space and boundaries and stopped talking to her because she didn't respect those. So, now I'm anxious again, even though I don't have to interact with her if I don't want to. I just wish she'd move on and stop clinging to me. I have no idea *why* she even clung to me to begin with. It's just irritating.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Blacks do go into the woods to enjoy the outdoors through activities like hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, etc... But, blacks only make up about 13% of the population of America. Also, not many blacks actually go into the woods; only a very small percentage of them are active in the wild outdoors. Therefore, I suspect that of all of the humans that regularly go into the woods in North America, probably less than 1% of them are black.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why bring this up? My point here is that Bigfoot is not used to seeing black folks. This may provoke certain responses by a Sasquatch when it sees a black person, such as: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Confusion; [linebreak] 2. Fear;  [linebreak] 3. Trepidation; and [linebreak] 4. Curiosity [linebreak]  [linebreak] I believe that all of these are responses that can work to our advantage.  All of these potential responses will cause a Bigfoot some amount of pause, and this slight pause may be the difference between getting off a kill shot and not.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fact is, sasquatch does not regularly see black people. Chances are better than not that when a Squatch sees a black person that it will be the first time it has ever seen one. It may get scared and freak out, or it may stand there and stare. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As a practical matter I think that a technique worth trying is to take a black person on some hunts. See how the Squatch population reacts to the black person and take note. I am aware of no other groups that have tried this, so I will be very interested to see the results.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are all sorts of variations on this concept. The goal here is to throw a Bigfoot off balance with some sort of odd occurrence in the woods. The idea is to create a weird scene in an area where Bigfoot are present and which is not threatening to the creature. At the same time, you want it to perplex the BF to the point where it is standing there just scratching its head at the spectacle. While this is going on we will have snipers strategically placed whose job is to locate the Sasquatch and to put a bullet in the animal's head.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Here are some other ideas I have to cause a Bigfoot to pause due to confusion:  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Outdoors sex/orgy: Get some skanky swingers group together and get them into the woods to screw and orgy in a Bigfoot hotspot. This will really pique a scratch's interest. At some point a Squatch will stick out its head to see what the fuck all that sucking and slapping noise is, then one of our snipers blows his brain out!  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 2. Poker game in the woods: same concept as the orgy but less gross. It probably will take longer to attract a Squatch.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 3. Strange looking people: these are people that Squatch are not used to seeing. For example, dress up like a party clown and walk around in a hotspot zone juggling bowling pins.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] 4. Fighting: put together a group of low-life fight-club types, take them into the woods and let them fight. The noise and weird scene will generate some Bigfoot interest.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some believe that Sasquatch are something like forest ninjas: fast and stealthy. I think that if you do something truly weird then we may be able to confuse and agitate the animal. Confusion and agitation does not comport with stealth and concealment. Therefore, we take the Squatch's advantage away from it. This will make it t more likely to show itself and, thereby, give us a shot at it.", "normal"], ["Your pulitzer's in the mail [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am a bot.

Encompassing strategies, various groups, and organized social movements to accomplish the goals of ending legalized racial segregation, disenfranchisement, and discrimination in the United States, the movement, using major nonviolent campaigns, eventually secured new recognition in federal law and federal protection for all Americans.

Before probably the late 90s/early 2000s you had to join a group to be radicalized. Not the case anymore. It's the same MO that ISIS uses \u2014 find young men who are somehow emotionally susceptible to propaganda; maybe they hold a lot of anger in, maybe they are (understandably) sad and resentful that they can't find someone to date, maybe they have some unresolved trauma... and they find an ideology that for some reason is an outlet for that \u2014 it gives you something to express your anger and emotions at (even if it may not be wholly logical but someone can convince you it is). You don't have to meet up with people to be a white supremacist. You don't have to indicate it to anyone outwardly. As long as you don't express it in public, and you contain it to your online persona, nobody really ever has to know. But that doesn't mean you're not a white supremacist. It's still infected your mind and poisoned your thoughts. And you do, quietly, support those whose actions support the lies you've been deceived by.

(WRIC) \u2014 A Chesterfield family spoke with 8News Friday after fending off a naked intruder who broke into their home on South Twilight Lane the night before. The intruder claimed to be the devil and attacked the family, prompting the homeowner to fire 39 rounds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The incident was a traumatic experience for the Lewis family's first night in their brand new home. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"She was in to kill us,\" Melissa Lewis said. \"That was her almighty, to kill us. She attacked us and I held her down just kept on punching her and punching her as hard as I possibly could.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Lewis' dream home now looks like a war zone, with blood soaked into the carpet, the walls and windows riddled with bullets and shell casings scattered all over. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"I said 'who are you?\" Lewis' husband, who did not wish to go on camera, explained. \"She said 'I need your help, please help me.' I said 'get out of my house,' and she goes 'I'm the devil.'\" [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The homeowner says the woman, who had a blue ponytail, broke into the basement around 10:30 p.m. on July 4. The family said she was laughing menacingly and refused to leave. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"She looked possessed, her eyes were completely black, like saucers, and she was laughing like it was a joke,\" Lewis's husband told 8News. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fearing for his life, the father of three grabbed his pistol and gave a verbal warning to the woman. With his family sleeping upstairs, he opened fire hoping to scare her off. None of the shots struck the suspect. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lewis said the woman aggressively charged at him with superhuman strength. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"She was not stopping,\" he said. \"She had the strength of four grown men.\" [linebreak]  [linebreak] When he ran out of bullets, Lewis began throwing furniture at her. His wife and children eventually jumped in and attempted to stop the woman. The intruder didn't stop until one of the children, the Lewis' 12-year-old son Logan, shoved a wrench into her neck. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Police arrested the intruder and she is being treated and evaluated at the hospital. The Lewis family left with bruises and bite marks. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \"I'm scared to go in there, I won't even go into any room by myself, I'm terrified,\" M. Lewis said.

It is troubling that the State elevates non-criminal matters into a criminal one based nothing on perpetrator motivation. The aforementioned swastika spray paint is no more difficult to clean off than a person scrawling their name.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > Digging further, the increase in reported hate crimes is driven primarily by these non-criminal acts.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > The disparity between real crime where people are harmed or property is irreparably lost and simple misdemeanor activity is staggering.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > An indicator hate crime isn't a problem is the rise of the hate crime hoax. According to researcher Wilfred Reilly, a Kentucky State professor of political science, there has been a [notable rise in hate crime hoaxes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hate-crime-hoaxes-are-more-common-than-you-think-11561503352).    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > In today's United States, there is immense value in becoming a victim of a hate crime. There is an outpouring of social support, TV circuit interviews and other social benefits. Being seen as authentic is so strong that people become [distraught when they find out they're not the ethnicity they think they are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhW-wpQPkX4); these individuals are motivated to become a victim of such an event to solidify their social standing.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > Through the fact that there are *any* hoax events indicates that the problem of hate is, by and large, solved.     [linebreak] >   [linebreak] >  [The overwhelming support such people obtain as the immediate snap decision ](https://mises.org/wire/how-oberlin-college-faculty-tried-destroy-small-business-imaginary-crimes)has indicated that our society doesn't tolerate such behavior and, since society doesn't tolerate the behavior, finding individuals is equally rare. One doesn't need to raise awareness when the events are so few that cable news outlets can justify days of debate over each event; we're already pretty much aware the moment they happen. But one does need to raise awareness if they wish to have their 15 minutes of fame.    [linebreak] >   [linebreak] > [As I previously noted](https://mises.org/wire/combat-hate-make-government-weaker), the number of people who buy into hate ideology, regardless of motivation, is so trivial that they couldn't even fill a minor league baseball stadium. There are more people than this who think the Earth is flat, yet no one considers that a growing trend. It would be impossible to casually talk about Nazis being evil if they had any semblance of power or authority as people would tread more carefully. Being anti-Nazi is a safe and easy way to win social points since there is almost zero risk of reprisal. Just ask Wilfred Reilly, who is on actual enemies lists, just how dangerous they are (they aren't). However, politicians, certain groups and many individuals have strong incentives to manufacture hate crimes where none exist as such events generate votes, revenue and social attention.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] This is a dicey topic.  Over there someone pointed out that she should have gone to a more pet friendly place, but people are forgetting that prior to ESA laws opening up, it was *impossible* to find pet friendly places.  *Especially* for large animals.  I lived in an apartment complex in the 00's with a dog run that allowed large dogs, and worked there for a bit.  We were the *only* complex that allowed dogs in the area, through the major city we abutted.  And by the time I left, they had come up with the brilliant idea of instituting \"pet rent,\" an increase of rent to cover pet fees on *top* of usurious non-refundable security fees.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] ESA certification allowed people to have a pet, a desperately needed pet who yes, have been proven to have deep psychological benefits to their people, without having to go through all of the difficulties.  Especially poor people, who are usually unable to find other methods of coping and need them the most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] On the other side, not everyone can handle ESA's.  I love dogs, I've had some amazing dogs.  But I was attacked as a child by a few dogs and it took a while for me to manage my fear and distrust.  I still have a deep and unreasonable hatred of cocker spaniels, can't help it.  My husband is allergic.  I am too, mildly though.  If the dog has been bathed in a week, I'm usually fine. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We were in a pizza restaurant eating and a couple came in with an [afghan dog](https://images.app.goo.gl/3FCkPSTc1Wooe39D6).  They allowed some children to play with and pet the dog, which was shedding noticeably as it was summer.  My husband started to have an allergic reaction.  The couple sat, he asked the pizza people to please have the dog put outside.  As he was doing this, some customers came in behind where my kid and I were sitting, saw the dog, made disgusted comments, and left. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Husband stormed back and left; they chose to keep the dog in the restaurant despite his visible allergic reaction.  My husband, the man I call Snow White incarnate, who held a battered dog on the side of the road we found until the police arrived to take her to the vet, just wanted to eat in peace and this was denied him.  So, we left.  The emotional presence of a dog for that couple was more important than the physical health of my husband. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've utilized the ESA privileges (for housing), as I do have qualifying conditions.  I've never taken my animals anywhere they wouldn't legally be allowed without it, however.  I still remember vividly what it felt like to have that dog turn and look at me and lunge.  I still see it every time I see a cocker spaniel.  I see my husband with certain dog breeds, even though he adored them, red eyed, runny nosed, choking.  I also remember how lucky I felt to find a place that allowed big dogs so I could get my girl, and the amazing life I had with her.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It seems to me we need to have much clearer rules.  We need to be able to have purely animal free places for people who legitimately need it *and* places that allow it.  The issue is that when you give a landlord the option, they will generally choose no animals since that is the cheapest option.  (Seriously, one couple force bred their Pitts to sell the litter - inbred idiots - and kept the pups indoors so we wouldn't know and then absconded in the night.  We had to go down to the sub floor it was so bad). If you force it to be open to all, then you have no place for the people who *can't* be around animals and are unable to afford to pay for a house.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] The dog in the restaurant is interesting. To my knowledge ESAs have no federal protections in restaurants. It's mostly that they get to live in domiciles and travel. I'm guessing your state could have extra protections. Your thinking is very considerate and I like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My last dog wasn't an ESA but he was a trained therapy dog. I say \"trained\" but he was a 3 pound long-hair chihuahua who already loved cuddles so it was mostly I who was trained. He would visit hospitals and nursing homes and even after he's passed we've kept in touch with some of the nursing home folk. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I plan on doing the same for my little guy.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] >Why are they worth less than people who need ESA's? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Agreed as well. Everyone's health concerns deserve to be taken into account and I do not envy the people who have to figure those things out.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] But like you said, clearer rules are needed. Not only for people who can't be around animals, but in situations like universities that aren't even the best/healthiest places for people, is it really in the best interest of all (including the animals themselves) to have animals in such tight, possibly unhealthy environments?

My uncle had a beautiful black lab when I was younger, sweet as could be, but we couldn't let him off-leash around my grandma because his idea of affection (leaning against you/pawing your knee for treats) were enough to knock her off balance/bruise her skin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry for the rant but ESAs are a real hot-button issue for me, especially dogs. There are countless people out there who benefit immensely from having a fuzzy bundle of unconditional affection in their lives, and for some that's literally all they need to get themselves together and better their lives. However, just because your dog is classified as an ESA _does not relieve you of the basic duties of being a dog owner_. That dog is not a functional member of society; it cannot feed, house or otherwise provide for itself. By bringing that animal into your life you are making a promise to it that you will provide it with all of the food, shelter, exercise, socialization, and whatever else it needs to be the best emotional support animal it can be. For a lot of people with self-worth/anxiety issues this isn't a problem; caring for your dog is a great way to build constructive habits that can lead to the confidence to tackling your own problems.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you are unable to provide this (which is _fine_ and quite possibly is no fault of your own), you need to seriously evaluate whether bringing an ESA into your home is going to help lift yourself up, or just drag your new friend down to your level.

There are many anime styles, but the cute big eyed+ small nose is popular and easy to do. It would be weird if in a simplified style you would make a broader extra detailed nose. The background setting and light matters too. Lighting and shading can affect skintone too. It's one thing if it's realism, but with anime styles you don't have to have realistic proportions ( nobody has huge anime eyes IRL lol). The colors look different on different types of screens and I know this because some of my old work looks very vibrant on my new laptop and kinda washed out on a phone screen. It would be cool if people stopped bitching and let artists enjoy creating art. Most fanart I do is usually unpaid work in my free time. With commissions I tell people to show me the exact color for skin, eyes and hair. I never had any complaints about how I draw poc. However, I don't like how artists are being treated. If you don't draw poc you are racist, if you do you are still racist because they are not dark enough.

The soviet population wasn't very fond of Stalin, and had the Germans not been as harsh as they were, they likely could have turned the soviet population on Stalin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Stalin actually thought the war was over. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > At 3.30 a.m. on 22 June 1941 the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, Georgi Zhukov, telephoned Stalin's dacha to rouse the Soviet leader from his sleep. The Germans, he told him, had begun shelling Red Army positions along the frontier. Stalin refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was under way. Surely, he told a small gathering of civilian and military leaders in Moscow later in the morning, Hitler did not know about it. There must be a conspiracy among the leaders of the German armed forces. It was only when the German Ambassador, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, met Foreign Minister Molotov in the Kremlin to hand over the German declaration of war that Stalin recognized he had been duped by Hitler. Initially shocked, embarrassed and disoriented, Stalin soon pulled himself together. On 23 June 1941 he worked at his desk in the Kremlin from 3.20 in the morning to 6.25 in the evening, gathering information and making the necessary arrangements for the creation of a Supreme Command to take charge of operations. As the days went by, he became increasingly dispirited by the scale and speed of the German advance. At the end of June, he left for his dacha, saying, in his inimitably coarse way, 'Everything's lost. I give up. Lenin founded our state and we've fucked it up.' He made no address to the Soviet people, he did not talk to his subordinates, he did not even answer the phone. German planes, indeed, dropped leaflets over the Red Army lines claiming that he was dead. When a delegation from the Politburo arrived at the dacha, they found Stalin slumped in an armchair. 'Why have you come?' he asked. With a thrill of terror, two members of the delegation, Mikoyan and Beria, realized he thought they had come to arrest him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And gave the famous speech, rallying the soviet population behind him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > Within a few days of retreating to his dacha in despair, Stalin recovered his nerve, if indeed he had really lost it. Some thought he had retreated into temporary isolation like Ivan the Terrible centuries before, to demonstrate his indispensability. A State Defence Committee was set up, with Stalin himself in the chair. His retreat had given him the chance to rethink his role. On 3 July 1941, the same day that Franz Halder confided to his diary his belief that victory had already been achieved by the German forces, Stalin spoke to the Soviet people over the radio, for the first time not as Communist dictator but as patriotic leader. 'Brothers and sisters,' he said, 'friends!' This was an entirely new note. He went so far as to admit that the Red Army had been unprepared for the attack. The Germans, he said, were 'wicked and perfidious . . . heavily armed with tanks and artillery'. But they would not prevail. The Soviet people had to organize civil defence and mobilize every ounce of energy to defeat the enemy. It was necessary to form partisan groups behind the lines to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. Silence, lies and evasion, people felt, had at last been replaced with some kind of truth. Communist Party propaganda began to emphasize the defence not of the revolution but of the motherland. The party newspaper, Pravda ('Truth'), dropped the slogan 'Workers of the World, Unite!' from its masthead and replaced it with 'Death to the German Invaders!' Nikolai Moskvin noted on 30 September 1941 that 'the mood of the local population has changed sharply'. From constantly threatening to betray him to the Germans, they came round to the patriotic cause after learning that the occupation authorities were keeping the collective farms going because it made it easier to collect the grain for transporting back to Germany. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > The speech's patriotic appeal was all the more powerful because people were already beginning to learn the bitter realities of German occupation. Stories of the horrors of the prisoner-of-war camps mingled with eyewitness reports of the mass shooting of civilians and the burning of villages by German troops to produce in the still-retreating ranks of the Red Army a determination to fight the enemy that had been almost entirely absent in the first chaotic days of the war. When the city of Kursk fell, the Germans arrested all the healthy male inhabitants, penned them into open barbed-wire enclosures without food or water, and then put them to work, guarded by Germans wielding rubber truncheons. 'The streets are empty,' noted a Soviet intelligence report. 'The shops have been looted. There is no mains water and no electricity. Kursk has collapsed.'", "normal"], ["Ima smack u in the jaw if this was copy pasted from wikipedia [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nice to meet a fellow history buff here bb [linebreak]  [linebreak] Got any other hot takes on ww1 or 2?

[linebreak]  [linebreak] So the baseline of what I understood is that she associates with EVERY woman displayed anywhere. So if a woman is stupid, shy or subserviant, she feels insulted. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point was: everyone is an individual, you are not all of those women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And then she said that I should also feel bad if there is a stupid man in a movie, but I have no point to feel that way. I am not that guy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Originally all stick figures in the game were male and it was also perceived as that by many, so I decided to put in female stick figures as well. So her perception that they look genderless was not shared by most. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In Supraland there are a few dumb teeny fangirls admiring a suprastar. That was the worst moment for her. She says that all women in the game are weak. She ignored that the main woman, the queen, is more dominant than both of the kings and is showing them the way, and she is also ordering the player around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So it seems that she wants all women to be strong and dominant. But the thing is, what hormons people run on is different from case to case. Depending on what happened to you in your life you run on different hormons. For example when a woman loses her man, she usually becomes more masculine to be able to survive and she becomes more feminine again when she gets a man again.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some women run on masculine hormones and are the tough ones. Many women are very feminine and enjoy being subserviant - and because of that nature they have no voice in public, because only dominant more masculine women are so extrovert to raise their voice. That is probably the reason for the disconnect between the media and the people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Same thing for men - many men are more on the feminine side and soft and also have a hard time in this society with it. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And my point of view in general: let everyone be just the way they are and let them do whatever they want. Don't force feminine people into being masculine, don't force masculine people into being feminine.

In the first two however, it's not always referring to trans women. While I'm sure that there are trans women in \"trap\" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. In that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to \"trick\" men, so it's an accurate description.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] But in the context of real life with real people, unless you're making a dark joke, you shouldn't really be calling a murderer via an anime stereotype because it's innacurate. Yandere is a thing in anime because of the context the media is built. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the same manner, traps don't mind being called traps because they don't exist, it doesn't help increase hate crime rate of anime characters if you address them by that term, and 'trap' has a use for anime community because it identifies characters that do not fall correctly under the trans nor crossdresser label.
