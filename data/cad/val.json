No?", "normal"], ["## Take 1: Autonomous vehicles will kill transit / will change transit so profoundly that we might as well stop building transit and wait for them to rescue us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. This also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. Look at it like this: [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? In the United States, about 650. (As of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? About 650. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. But in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 2: Transit agencies in Asia can turn a profit, so European and North American agencies should be able to do so as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Insofar as transit agencies in Asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. But this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a friend who plays the trombone. She makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. Of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. Should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 3: Free transit would solve a lot of problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (After all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. For example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on New Year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. You might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. Makes a lot of sense. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. Specifically, free transit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Causes driver morale to plummet. [linebreak] 2. Causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (If you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.) [linebreak] 3. Turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels. [linebreak] 4. Attracts hooligans. (They can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.) [linebreak] 5. As a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages \"choice\" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (If they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.) [linebreak] 6. Significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. Even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. Covering the farebox just unleashes it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 4: My city has terrible transit. It's so much better in [x]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You think transit's better in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, Sydney, whatever? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. But go to that city's subreddit and I guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, Portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. If you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. You have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 5: Here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This goes for: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Aerial tramways [linebreak] 2. Monorails [linebreak] 3. People-movers [linebreak] 4. Personal Rapid Transit [linebreak] 6. [Chinese straddling buses](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus1/18bus1-jumbo.jpg) [linebreak] 5. River ferries [linebreak] 6. etc. etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. There are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides \"hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!\") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. On the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos! [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), I've got a simple truism for you. You need one of two things: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. A *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load. [linebreak] 2. A *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. Usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. Detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. Sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. New Orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] As with all societal trends it's complicated but I think media plays the most significant role.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Movies, TV, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. Even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  And heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead I think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. Even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is an element of health involved. No doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but I think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that I find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The average size of Americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people I cant wrap my head around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of Americans. At this moment, some 2/3rds of Americans are overweight or obese.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this AITA post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and I'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  >Mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Absolutely. Especially I think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.

This is something that is not really mentioned but is wholly related. Obviously, cars are a huge risk to those who ride a motorcycle for the same reasons cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What you're taught as a motorbike rider, the most important lesson, is that you're responsible for you. You cannot rely on a driver to be looking out for you. Not because they don't want to but because, like cyclists, you're less visible. Cars have blind spots and you can't expect them to always see you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second most valuable lesson is that motorcyclists tend to make better drivers because they're more aware on the road and responsible for their driving decisions. They're more concerned about reacting to other drivers decisions rather than driving on autopilot and going, \"oopsie\" when something unexpected happens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being aware of your surroundings as a cyclist or motorcyclist is still essential to safety. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Cyclists need to be aware on footpaths (sidewalks)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] A car is predictable. In most cases, a car will be on the road. Unless it's pulling out of a driveway it's very rare to see a car that isn't on the road and it's impossible to see a road and not know that a motor-vehicle will use that road. Driving has rules. You stick to the designated areas and should there be any reason to be where a pedestrian might walk you look and wait for any to pass.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The same isn't said for footpaths (or sidewalks I think it's called where you are), bike tracks and cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the case in many places here that both footpaths and bike tracks are shared by pedestrians and cyclists. It doesn't make sense to me either but basically, there are footpaths that just end in bike tracks and force pedestrians to use the bike track to get from point A to B. This usually isn't a big problem and pedestrians on a bike track are automatically more aware of the possibility of a cyclist. (If ever a reason to have ***more*** bike tracks exists, this is not a bad one at all) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is the unpredictability of cyclists and a lack of presence.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A cyclist, here at least, is in no way predictable. A pedestrian will use a footpath, a car will use a road and a cyclist will use whatever is convenient at the time. With a lack of presence, it's impossible to know if you'll even see a cyclist on that day. Together you end up with both drivers and pedestrians not being able to anticipate if or when a cyclist is going to be there or how they're going to behave. This means a cyclist has to be more aware of their surroundings than the pedestrian as the pedestrian has no way of knowing how to react even when aware of the cyclist due to the unpredictability of the situation. In my experience with cyclists, there is no definitive answer to \"how do I avoid a pedestrian\". Some move to one side of the footpath, some ride on the road, some ring their bell so you can move out of their way and some creepily follow behind at a slow pace without ringing their bell until you notice and step out of their way like they expect you to be psychic or something. That last category is the jerks.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike with cars, there isn't some set rule that applies to all cyclists and pedestrians and unlike bike tracks, you can't stay aware of things you're unlikely to encounter.

He interrupted her and said  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >\"You and I may have a disagreement on this,\" Sanders said, \"because it's not just black, and it is Latino, there are areas in America, including poor rural areas, where it is white. Okay?\"  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He seriously told a black woman he disagrees with her on racism! He told her they had a disagreement on her own life experiences!

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Another classic example of Bernie's deliberate cluelessness when it comes to race is is [this series of tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/794941635931099136) in which, three days before the election in 2016, he said Trump supporters are not racist and everyone else has a responsibility to reach out the Trump supporters and build a better society for them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another great example was when he said [\"There are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American.\"](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-on-andrew-gillium-and-stacey-abrams-many-whites-uncomfortable-voting-for-black-candidates).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My personal favorite, which is to say least favorite, is the time that an audience member at one of his appearances said she wants to become the second Latina Senator in US history, and he cut her off to say [\"It's not good enough for somebody to say 'hey I'm a Latina vote for me' that is not good enough.\"](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/94221972)  [linebreak]  [linebreak] One that's less serious but still deeply concerning to me personally is this [piece of creative writing from him where he describes a woman being bound and gang-raped in graphic detail. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy) I really just don't trust men who fantasize about abusing women.

Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funds cannot be used to pay for abortion. If his proposed healthcare plan was put into place, it'd become even harder for women to access abortions than it already is,  because there would no longer be private insurance carriers.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if he improves his plan, he's shown repeatedly that he just doesn't value women's reproductive rights that much.

Here, let me give you some advice: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 1 - Just roll into Boss attacks mostly, their attacks are really telegraphed so even with garbage reaction times you should still see em coming. For most common hollows, don't lock on, run past them, pivot and backstab (their tracking is really shitty so you can dance circles around their attacks). You can also run straight to the boss rooms since you get iframes on going through fog walls. Learn your parry timings, especially on Black Knights and Gwyn, the greatsword ones are the easiest due to how telegraphed their attacks are. Don't wear heavy armor and always fast roll unless you got that sweet 76 poise and a high stability greatshield. Oh, and always kill the dogs first. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 2 - The PVE in this game is cancer, but you should be in this game for the PVP. The tracking is insane so backstabbing enemies is not a cakewalk. There are no iframes on fog walls so getting into boss rooms is even more of a task but the great thing is, the bosses in this game are super easy - they're mainly just variants of armored knights. My advice is, increase your adaptability so you can get atleast 99 / 100 agility for those extra roll / backstep iframes. Upgrade your weapons as soon as possible and keep your equip load under 50. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 3? It's pretty much just DS1 but with a some Bloodborne style faster paced action in it.

People struggle to remember the names of almost any character in the film, there are no memorable quotes from it in the pop cultural lexicon, no scenes or plot concepts getting referenced or homaged, nobody walking around in Avatar t-shirts, etc. Compare it to Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, E.T., Jaws, Titanic, Batman, Frozen, or any other cultural and financial *phenomenon*, and its content is a total obscurity. Even Shrek and Pirates Of The Carribean had a way bigger pop culture impact, for their first couple films anyway. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Point being, it's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way that the highest grossing movie in the entire 100-year history of the medium has, for a decade now, been one that's significant almost entirely for a camera gimmick. Even other films like The Wizard Of Oz, Star Wars and Jurassic Park which are similarly famous for their gamechanging technological breakthroughs *also* had iconic stories, characters and dialogue which have long outlasted the novelty of their SFX. [linebreak]  [linebreak] An Avengers film *finally* topping Avatar at the box office feels more like a victory for common sense than brand loyalty, because the *content* of the Marvelverse has had all the ubiquitous cultural impact that Avatar lacked, and it's nice to know that more human beings have connected with something like that, than just been roped into going to the theater for some 3D hype alone.

More specifically, I used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in Australia.  Over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. The goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. This reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  Plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.

That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a \"wrong\" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, \"would,\" as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Phew..", "normal"], ["Anyone old enough to remember Youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *Smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that \"You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes.\" This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).", "hatespeech"], ["That is so egotistical to do.

It's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. And not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. It is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). This group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. The more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like JusticeServed and the now-defunct Cringe Anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to \"the other\". And this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. And, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a \"crazy feminist\". Though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the \"centrist\" h3h3/Rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, I do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. However, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. And, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. Incel culture needs to be countered, not justified. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I, personally, have my own problems with incelTears. I think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. And, too often, I think some also engage in a problematic \"Just World\" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] \u200b [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Powerful and Oppressive Tech companies: We have citizens that are blindly allegiant to tech companies that represents ideas that are completely failing thanks to the very ideals they worship.

I have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. Nobody cares. There are people in CONCENTRATION CAMPS in this country. (How much clearer does it need to be?) There are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. And any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: The country BLOWS up. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MEN SUFFER TOO. Even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. And it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. They just HATE men. Which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. In general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about \"spectrums\" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u200b [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Identification of Enemies as a Unifying Cause: LGBTQ Republicans, White people, Black Christians, Middle-Easterners, Jewish people, etc. It's the SAME strategy every time: The tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. To convince you that \"these degenerates and undesirables\" are the reason your life is going to shit. They don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. They also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. This helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u200b [linebreak]  [linebreak] It makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. Since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. And angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary \"social justice\" or \"dismantling\" movements. They now all hate right-wing people, Christians, white people, Jews are all white supremacists to them, and they DEFINITELY hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods...

We spend FAR more than everybody else, even if A TON of that money could be far better used elsewhere. We've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the Nixon-era to believe this is necessary... And after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. This is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. They conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. They say it's \"moral\" to do that. This is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. They just call you \"immoral\" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] \u200b [linebreak]  [linebreak] A logical person sees these media for what they are: Stupid, braindead, and they're MASSIVELY contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. If you criticize any of this? Well, they wouldn't want a repeat of Gamergate. They started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to \"Learn to Code\", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. You should know that.) And again, ANY time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-Gamergate era, they can pull the: \"THIS IS HARRASSMENT!

Black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in America: Blacks, males especially, commit I think the highest amount of crime in the country. And hmm, I wonder why?

They think \"social science\" told us that women are oppressed. You say \"no, they're not...\" Then they say:\"Can you prove that?!\" And the \"social science\" card effectively shuts down all rational political discourse.
