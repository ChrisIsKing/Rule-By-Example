Just like there are people who assume evolution will not work, there are people who will assume a Wiki will not work, and probably for the same reasons (well, other than religion)  because it seems complicated an esoteric with so much seemingly left to freedom and chance, when in fact the wikis are constantly selected back to the facts.

You've changed it to read that she IS a companion, which makes the whole section redundant. If she's in the Eleventh Doctor table, anything else can be expressed through footnotes as with other characters. (Incidentally, the bottom paragraph doesn't read correctly since your edits but I am unable to change as I'm not 100% on what your intended meaning is.) \n The problem is, asserting that she's definitely a companion for series 6 presents difficulties. The source only calls her a \"\"companion\"\", it doesn't specify any particular episodes and it's hard to use that to say she's a companion in series 6 but not 5 or 4. But conversely, I don't think anyone considers it correct to call her a companion of the Tenth Doctor. If she's in the table, it means she has to be added to Template:Eleventhdoctorcompanions and the articles for specific episodes, and despite the slight narrative change I mentioned on the project page I don't feel there's really enough to distinguish between series 6 and her previous appearances.

Well, it is well-established that Latin fell out of official use in the administration in the 7th century, when most of the Latin-speaking provinces were lost (Africa, Spania, much of Illyricum, most of Italy), but already in the 6th century, Greek was on the march (the Novellae of Justinian) for judicial and administrative purposes (cf. Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, p. 1175 on \"\"Language\"\"). Latin certainly survived in isolated pockets in the Balkans (the Vlachs, as you correctly point out), but in no way as an \"\"official\"\" language. And most of the Balkans was, from the mid-7trh century, dominated by the Slavs and the Bulgars, who did not use Latin at all. Instead, some inscriptions in Greek raised by the first Bulgar monarchs survive. Usage of Latin characters in coins is not a convincing argument to the usage of the usage of the Latin language. The Byzantines were nothing if not traditionalists, especially in matters of imperial ceremonial, protocol and representation, which includes the imperial coinage. If you read the De Ceremoniis, you'll find several Latin acclamations preserved (in a corrupted form), from the 4th-6th centuries, but they are exactly that: preserved ceremonial acclamations, not evidence of a living language. The same goes for the coins, i.e. they follow models from the past. Latin was only known by a few well-educated men by the 9th century, and in a very superficial manner by professions were it had survived in terminology, i.e. lawyers and the military (in the form of commands).

In this work he described that on 29 September he arrived at Tourbilly, which he characterized as:  \n\n : \"\"... a poor village, of a few scattered houses, in a vale between two rising grounds, which are yet heath and waste; the chateau in the midst, with plantations of fine poplars leading to it.\"\" \n\n Young recalled  \n :\"\"I had read the translation of the marquis's history of his improvements in Mr.Mills' husbandry,*78 and thought it the most interesting morsel I had met with, long before I procured the original Memoire sur les defrichemens; and determined that if ever I should go to France to view improvements the recital of which had given me such pleasure...\"\"  \n\n First he described the encounter with the then present owner: \n :\"\"I had neither letter nor introduction to the present owner, the marquis de Galway. I therefore stated to him the plain fact, that I had read Mons. de Tourbilly's book with so much pleasure, that I wished much to view the improvements described in it; he answered me directly in good English, received me with such cordiality of politeness, and such expressions of regard for the purport of my travels, that he put me perfectly in humour with myself, and consequently with all around me. He ordered breakfast a l' Angloise; gave orders for a man to attend us in our walk, who I desired might be the oldest labourer to be found of the late marquis de Tourbilly's. I was pleased to hear that one was alive who had worked with him from the beginning of his improvement. At breakfast Mons. de Galway introduced me to his brother, who also spoke English, and regretted that he could not do the same to Madame de Galway, who was in the straw: he then gave me an account of his father's acquiring the estate and chateau of Tourbilly. His great-grand-father came to Bretagne with King James II. when he fled from the English throne; some of the same family are still living in the county of Cork, particularly at Lotta. His father was famous in that province for his skill in agriculture; and, as a reward for an improvement he had wrought on the landes, the states of the province gave him a waste tract in the island of Belleisle, which at present belongs to his son. Hearing that the marquis de Tourbilly was totally ruined, and his estates in Anjou to be sold by the creditors, he viewed them, and finding the land very improveable, made the purchase, giving about 15,000 louis d'ors for Tourbilly, a price which made the acquisition highly advantageous, not withstanding his having bought some law-suits with the estate. It is about 3000 arpents, nearly contiguous, the seigneury of two parishes, with the haute justice, &c.; a handsome large and convenient chateau, offices very compleat, and many plantations, the work of the celebrated man concerning whom my enquiries were directed.\"\" \n\n About Turbilly's bankruptcy, Young learned: \n :\"\"I was almost breathless on the question of so great an improver being ruined! \"\"You are unhappy that a man should be ruined by an art you love so much.\"\" Precisely so. But he eased me in a moment, by adding, that if the marquis had done nothing but farm and improve, he had never been ruined. One day, as he was boring to find marl, his ill stars discovered a vein of earth, perfectly white, which on trial did not effervesce with acids. It struck him as an acquisition for porcelain \u2014 he shewed it to a manufacturer \u2014 it was pronounced excellent: the marquis's imagination took fire, and he thought of converting the poor village of Tourbilly into a town, by a fabric of china \u2014 he went to work on his own account \u2014 raised buildings \u2014 and got together all that was necessary, except skill and capital. \u2014 In fine, he made good porcelain, was cheated by his agents, and people, and at last ruined. A soap manufactory, which he established also, as well as some law-suits relative to other estates, had their share in causing his misfortunes: his creditors seized the estate, but permitted him to administer it till his death, when it was sold. The only part of the tale that lessened my regret was, that, though married, he left no family; so that his ashes will sleep in peace, without his memory being reviled by an indigent posterity. His ancestors acquired the estate by marriage in the fourteenth century. His agricultural improvements, Mons. Galway observed, certainly did not hurt him; they were not well done, nor well supported by himself, but they rendered the estate more valuable; and he never heard that they had brought him into any difficulties.

He had played on Edmonton Oilers for years beaming quite the legend. He later then moved to Boston Bruins in his Career.

His baseball career involved negatives at the beginning,  then later he got his legend status. That is right he is Jackie Robbinson, he suffered abuse from racist fans in his early  days. He took the abuse and he ended up being the first ever black baseball player too, truly a legend. After retiring from all those sports he found his true profession in life, Professional football.  He went up through Inter Milan youth system,  him and balotelli fucked shit up. They got 210 goals combined in his first debut season. Him and Balotelli decided to go on and make them own team. It was Balotelli FC where people of white consent were not allowed to play. He went bar down 200 times with Balotelli FC.

Their team is  among 7 different leagues, they brought Italy to greatness winning the world cup 2 times, still to this day Balotelli and Nathan fuck shit up.

For the rest: on balance, the upmerge side had the stronger arguments by far. Neither #2 and #3, either of which could theoretically justify the deletion of the category on policy and guideline grounds, were not challenged. The keep side pointed out some virtues of the categories, but nothing that was particularly convincing or based on a policy or guideline.

Finally, IronDuke has gone away.  I would thank you to take the time to educate yourself on the issue if you choose to intervene further.    \n :I see that this has been resolved by AbsCom.

It is not going 'there are 1,306,313,812, not 1,306,313,811 people in China, as we were told.' It is expected in a school of the quality of Grammar that the information provided is factually correct and up to date. There should be no need for students to have to question whether the information is accurate. If there is a need of that, students would be better off going to a state school, instead of forking out $12,500 in school fees for the already over-payed staff. I refuse to simply say that grammar is a top school in queensland, if it conveniently avoids its detriments instead of facing them and trying to solve them. at least they can stop lying about the range of subjects which they teach. I refuse to accept lies.   \n\n :Liberal education means a large number of subjects, not validity of information. I agree with the above post in full.   \n\n I would disagree. A liberal education means that it isn't limited by traditionalistic dogma or orthodoxy, such as the 'liberal policy' in the 'Liberal' Parties  that appear in politics. It may mean that the school takes a liberal approach to the education it offers, and encourages the students to question established opinions (not facts). I cannot comment on the manner in which the subjects are taught at BGS, but I wouldn't base conclusions on data that is irrelevant (ie. the number of subjects). In fact, a narrower range of subjects is actually more liberal for each individual student, as long as the subjects are more general (eg. history, geography, english, science, maths). With a plethora of highly specific subjects, students tend to specialise and ignore all the other areas of study, leading to narrow-mindedness. Hence, without more data, you have no grounds to dispute the statement. \n\n User: 138.130.220.222, the world is not black and white. Headhunter did not mean when the teacher says something, students argue as to the authenticity of the statement. As ^^ said, it\u2019s rather expressing their opinion in a welcoming fashion, rather than the curriculum\u2019s view. The school doesn\u2019t focus purely on learning information to be tested on. Although testing is important, the idea of questioning given information allows the student to fully understand the topic not just for the benefit of getting good grades, but to actually learn about the topic, not just memorising dates. The attention to detail in grammars confined curriculum is what places it as one of the Top schools in Queensland.  \n\n Your basis for argument is that the school should focus on quantity, rather than quality. Why are people still coming back to the school? Get your facts right and stop posting blatently un-supported, speculative dribble \n\n == Sexual Scandal == \n\n The school was involved in a sex scandal with a male teacher a few years back. It was announced at a 'speech night' of the school, in which the headmaster gave the damning address. It vaguely told of the incident, but was rather ambiguous and non-direct. Wikipedia is about truth, is it not? Should this not be the aim of wikipedia? as I see it, this article tells only the side of the school which is positive and all happy-go-happy. I think that all must be revealed. Please don't delete my addition to the article. There is no written record of the incident, because obviously the school does not want to publicise the scandal to the community. I belive that all should be told on this website.

There are more speakers of Pakistani, Urdu, Punjabi, etc than either Welsh or Cornish speakers. To include Welsh as a regional language you woukd also have to list those as well.    \n\n ::::::\"\"Of course near a country border there will be an overspill of one country's language(s) into another\"\"\u2014overspill? So people spoke English in Oswestry before they spoke Welsh? Welsh has been a regional language of England. At one time is was widely spoken in the Marches, in addition to other Brittonic languages such as Cumbric and Cornish in their respective areas. How can you say Welsh isn't a regional language while Cornish is, simply because the areas where it is natively spoken are near another country where it is significantly more predominant? Welsh is a native language of England, unlike migrant languages. I accept most of the 8,000 Welsh speakers in England are probably from Wales, but a significant amount will be native English people in the border counties, like I said, where there is significant mixed heritage.    \n ::::The figure of 110,000 is \"\"an estimate of those who could at an earlier time speak Welsh. Not all of them would still consider themselves able to speak Welsh.\"\"  Many people born in Wales, and all those taught in Wales in recent years, would have learned to speak at least some Welsh.  That does not mean they are Welsh speakers now.  The claims by  that Welsh is spoken by \"\"more native English in border communities then Cornish. Places like Oswestry still have significant numbers of Welsh speakers.\"\" - need a good source.  And, the fact is that Welsh is not an officially recognised regional language in any part of England  - though Cornish is.      \n :::::Absolutely\u2014as the writers of the report acknowledge (and I myself noted above) 110,000 is bound to be an overestimate, but 8,248 is just as likely to be an underestimate. In any case, as I noted again, I agree that Welsh almost certainly shouldn't be listed in the article as a regional language. The point is not of course how many speakers it has (it has more than Cornish however you count it) but whether or not it is officially recognised as a regional language, or is spoken by a substantial community of people who weren't born in Wales. The first isn't the case, and we need a good source for the second. Unfortunately, I'm not sure there really are any.    \n ::::::I accept it needs a source. However as far as I know, Cornish is not an \"\"officially recognised regional language\"\" of England specifically. The Cornish council has a policy to support the language, and it's a recognised regional language of the United Kingdom, in addition to Welsh and others. But there's nothing in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that designates the region of the UK for each language.    \n ::::::I found an interesting peice on this from the Welsh Language Board: Estimation of the number of Welsh speakers in England \n\n :::::::The estimate that 110,000 people resident in England can speak Welsh is reasonable. Such a number \u2013 together with another thousand in Scotland and Northern Ireland \u2013 would mean that the total number of people able to speak Welsh in the UK exceeds 690,000 and that some 17% of them live outside Wales elsewhere in the UK.  \n\n ::::::And \n\n :::::::Applying these percentages to the Census total of 42,358,885 non-Welsh-born residents of England produces very approximately a central estimate of 12,000 with a lower estimate of 8,000 and a higher of 13,000. \n\n ::::::Of course, we still can't determine for certain if these are native English, or descendants of Welsh people who have moved to England. \n ::::::   \n\n ::::::Oh, so I just realised this is the source you were discussing.

Originally when the project came to be, I thought that it was still possible to make cel animation. However, it is getting harder and harder to find people who will paint the cels and people who will film the cels. It seems like the industry is going more and more toward computers and it is getting harder and harder to make cel animation.  \t  \n\n Mr. Akai  \t The first series was on cels and it was filmed on 35 millimeter prints, kind of like feature films, but the second season is going to be on computers. \n AQ  \t Will this cause a big difference in the look of the series or is it going to have the same basic style? \n Mr. Akai  \t As long as you are watching it on television, it is not going to make a big difference.

The second season will pick up from the beginning of the fourth volume. However, the Tv series has surpassed the comic book in its speed and the Tv series is going to end before the comic book. The author has said that you can't really end it in the same way, you just cant. So the later half of the second season is going to be very different from the comic book. \n  \t In fact, Gainax itself has not been given the details of the way that the comic is going to go. So we are kind of .. trying to find our way in the dark. \n AT  \t What was it about the Mahoromatic story that said to you, \"\"This is going to make a great animation. People are really going to want to watch this?\"\" \n Mr. Yamaga  \t Originally, Pioneer had brought the comic book to us and presented the series. We did not really look at it very carefully. We realized that it was a particular genre called the Maid genre. We hadn't done that yet and it seemed a little bit interesting, so we decided to make Mahoromatic. \n\n  \n http://web.archive.org/web/20040101025405/http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=299 \n\n  \n AQ  \t The ending of Mahoromatic has a very enjoyable dance video sequence. Did you come up with that using live dancers? \n Mr. Yamaga  \t Actually, I came up with it at night and just kind of figured it out. I felt very silly when I'm did it at night. I did a little bit and wrotes it down, did a little bit more and wrote it down. That is kind of how it was made.
